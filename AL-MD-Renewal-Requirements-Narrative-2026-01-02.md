## BOARD INFORMATION & AUTHORITY

### Board Structure and Designation

[FACT - STATUTE] The Alabama Board of Medical Examiners and Medical Licensure Commission operates under Ala. Code § 34-24-75 and related statutes to regulate physicians in Alabama.

[FACT - BOARD] Board website (redirects from albme.org): https://www.albme.gov
[FACT - BOARD] Board phone: (334) 242-4116
[FACT - BOARD] Licensee Gateway (renewal portal): https://www.albme.gov/licensing/md-do/licensing-md-do-license-renewals/

### Authority for CME Requirements

[FACT - STATUTE] Per Ala. Code § 34-24-75: "Every physician licensed to practice medicine in Alabama who resides or practices in the state must earn in each calendar year, on or before December 31, not less than twenty-five (25) AMA PRA Category I Credits™ or equivalent as defined in Alabama rules of continuing medical education."

[FACT - ADMIN_CODE] Detailed CME rules are codified in Alabama Administrative Code r. 540-X-14 (Continuing Medical Education).

### Unified Board for MD and DO

[FACT - STATUTE] Alabama operates a single unified medical board that regulates both allopathic (MD) and osteopathic (DO) physicians under the same licensure framework and CME requirements.

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] This unified structure means core CME requirements are identical for MD and DO physicians, though DO physicians may have additional osteopathic-specific requirements managed separately.

---

## LIFECYCLE PHASES & GRACE PERIODS

### Annual License Renewal Cycle

[FACT - STATUTE] Per Ala. Code § 34-24-337 and board website: All physician licenses expire **December 31 of each calendar year** and must be renewed annually before that deadline.

[FACT - STATUTE] The renewal period is **October 1 - December 31** of each year when physicians can submit renewal applications.

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] This creates a **12-month renewal cycle** (calendar year), requiring physicians to maintain 25 CME hours during the immediately preceding 12 months (January 1 - December 31).

### Grace Period for Late Renewal

[FACT - STATUTE] Per Ala. Code § 34-24-337: "When a licensee fails to renew his or her license on or before December 31, the license shall remain in full force and effect during the period January 1 through January 31."

[FACT - STATUTE] During the grace period (Jan 1-31), physicians may renew with:
- Payment of the standard renewal fee
- Attestation of CME completion
- Payment of a **late fee not to exceed $200**

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] After January 31, the license becomes inactive/lapsed, requiring a formal reinstatement application rather than a simple renewal.

### New Licensee Grace Period

[CRITICAL GAP] The CME requirement for newly licensed physicians is addressed in statute, but specific details on first-year grace periods or reduced requirements are not explicitly documented.

[FACT - STATUTE] Per Ala. Code § 34-24-75: "Physicians receiving their initial license to practice medicine in Alabama are exempt from the minimum continuing medical education requirement for the calendar year in which they receive their license."

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] Newly licensed physicians are **fully exempt** from CME requirements in the calendar year of initial licensure. CME requirements begin the following calendar year.

---

## CME REQUIREMENTS - TOTAL HOURS & CATEGORIES

### Required CME Hours

[FACT - STATUTE] Per Ala. Code § 34-24-75: Physicians must earn **25 AMA PRA Category 1 Credits™, AOA Category 1-A credits or equivalent** **per calendar year** (January 1 - December 31).

[FACT - ADMIN_CODE] Per Ala. Admin. Code r. 540-X-14: Credits must be earned within the specified calendar year and cannot be carried over to subsequent years.

### CME Category Requirements

[FACT - STATUTE] Acceptable CME includes:
- **AMA PRA Category 1 Credits™** (primary)
- **AOA Category 1-A credits** (for osteopathic continuing education)
- **Equivalent programs** from accredited organizations
- **AAFP-prescribed credits**
- **ACOG-approved programs**

[FACT - BOARD] Per Alabama Board website, accredited CME providers include:
- Medical Association of the State of Alabama
- Accreditation Council for Continuing Medical Education (ACCME)
- Any ACCME-accredited provider

### No Carryover Policy

[FACT - ADMIN_CODE] Per Ala. Admin. Code r. 540-X-14: Alabama does **NOT allow carryover** of CME credits from one calendar year to the next.

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] All 25 hours must be earned and completed between January 1 and December 31 of each year. Excess hours earned in one year do not apply to the next year's requirement.

---

## CME TOPIC REQUIREMENTS

### Mandatory Professional Boundaries Course (New 2025)

[FACT - BOARD] Effective in 2025, all actively licensed physicians are required to complete a **2-hour on-demand course** entitled "Navigating Professional Boundaries in Medicine."

**Deadline for Existing Licensees:** [FACT - BOARD] **December 31, 2025** (one-time deadline for all physicians who held licenses before January 1, 2025)

**Deadline for New Licensees:** [FACT - BOARD] **Within 12 months of receiving licensure** (for physicians licensed on or after January 1, 2025)

[FACT - BOARD] The course is provided **free of charge** by the board through PBI Education and can be accessed online.

[FACT - BOARD] Exemption: Limited licensees (residents and fellows enrolled in residency or clinical fellowship training programs) are **exempt** from this requirement.

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] This 2-hour professional boundaries requirement is a one-time mandate and does count toward the 25-hour annual CME requirement.

### No Topic-Specific Recurring Requirements (Except ACSC)

[FACT - STATUTE] Alabama statute does not mandate specific recurring topics beyond the professional boundaries course and ACSC holder requirements (see below).

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] Physicians may select their remaining CME hours (approximately 23 hours for 2025+, after professional boundaries compliance) from any AMA Category 1 or equivalent programs in their specialty areas.

---

## CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE CONTEXT

### Alabama Controlled Substances Certificate (ACSC) Holders

[FACT - STATUTE] Per Ala. Code § 34-24-75 and Ala. Admin. Code r. 540-X-14: Physicians holding an **Alabama Controlled Substances Certificate (ACSC)** must complete **2 AMA PRA Category 1 Credits™** in controlled substance-related topics **every 2 years** (biennial).

[FACT - STATUTE] Acceptable controlled substance CME topics include:
- Controlled substance prescribing practices
- Recognizing signs of abuse or misuse of controlled substances
- Controlled substance prescribing for chronic pain management

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] The biennial 2-hour controlled substance requirement for ACSC holders applies on a two-year cycle separate from the annual 25-hour requirement. These 2 hours count toward the annual 25-hour total.

[FACT - BOARD] The Alabama Board of Medical Examiners offers CME courses specifically designed to meet ACSC requirements, including "Prescribing and Pharmacology of Controlled Drugs."

### Non-ACSC Holders

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] Physicians who do not hold an ACSC (do not prescribe, dispense, or distribute controlled substances) are **not subject** to the specific 2-hour controlled substance CME requirement, though such content may count toward general CME if taken.

### DEA Registration vs. Alabama ACSC

[CRITICAL GAP] The statute does not explicitly distinguish between DEA registration requirements and Alabama ACSC registration, though the two are related licensing requirements in federal and state law.

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] Physicians with DEA registration will typically also need ACSC registration and will therefore be subject to the 2-hour biennial controlled substance CME requirement.

---

## AUDIT & VERIFICATION PROCEDURES

### Random Annual Audits

[FACT - BOARD] Per board website: "A random audit of physicians and assistants to physicians is completed annually."

[FACT - BOARD] Licensees are **not required** to submit CME certificates with their renewal application. The board will request documentation if the physician is selected for audit.

### Proof of CME Completion

[FACT - BOARD] When selected for audit, physicians must submit proof of CME completion, which includes:
- Certificates of attendance
- Completion certificates
- Proof of registration
- Similar documentation issued by the sponsoring organization

[FACT - ADMIN_CODE] Per Ala. Admin. Code r. 540-X-14: Licensees are **required to maintain personal CME records for 3 years** following the calendar year in which the CME was earned.

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] Documentation should include:
- Course name and provider
- Date of completion
- CME hours awarded
- Category level (Category 1, Category 1-A, etc.)
- Provider's official documentation

### Documentation Upload Feature

[FACT - BOARD] Licensees are **encouraged** to use the CME documentation upload feature available through the Licensee Gateway for convenience and to prepare for potential audits.

### Penalty for Non-Compliance

[CRITICAL GAP] Specific penalties for CME non-compliance during audit are not detailed in statute or board materials reviewed. However, failure to meet CME requirements or failure to respond to audit without reasonable cause likely constitutes grounds for disciplinary action.

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] Non-compliance reported to audits could result in disciplinary action reported to the National Practitioner Data Bank and potential license suspension or other sanctions.

---

## EXEMPTIONS & ALTERNATIVES

### Retired Physicians Exemption

[FACT - STATUTE] Per Ala. Code § 34-24-75: "A physician who is retired from medicine and do[es] not practice medicine in any form, including the prescribing of any drugs, legend or controlled, may request an exemption from the CME requirement."

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] Retired physicians must apply for and receive an exemption from the board. This is not automatic and requires verification of non-practice status.

### ABMS Board Certification and Maintenance of Certification

[FACT - BOARD] Per Alabama Board website and administrative materials: **ABMS member board certification and Maintenance of Certification (MOC®) are recognized and count toward CME requirements.**

[CRITICAL GAP] Whether ABMS board certification provides a **full exemption** from the 25-hour requirement or only **partial credit** toward the requirement is not explicitly stated in statute or board materials.

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] Based on the language that MOC activities "count toward CME requirements," it appears board-certified physicians receive credit but may not be fully exempted from the 25-hour minimum.

**Recommendation for Clarification:** Contact the Alabama Board of Medical Examiners directly to confirm whether ABMS/MOC activities satisfy the entire 25-hour requirement or only provide partial credit.

### Hardship and Medical Exemptions

[FACT - STATUTE] Per Ala. Code § 34-24-75: "A physician who is unable to meet the minimum continuing medical education requirement because of illness, disability, or other circumstances beyond his control may apply to the Board of Medical Examiners for a waiver, which may be granted or denied within the sole discretion of the Board."

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] Waiver requests are discretionary and granted on a case-by-case basis. Physicians must document the hardship and submit a formal waiver request to the board.

### Resident and Fellow Physicians

[FACT - BOARD] Resident physicians and clinical fellows with **limited licenses** are **exempt** from the professional boundaries CME requirement.

[CRITICAL GAP] Whether resident/fellow physicians are exempt from the general 25-hour annual CME requirement is not documented in statute or board materials reviewed.

**Recommendation:** Contact board directly to clarify CME requirements for resident physicians under limited licenses.

---

## RENEWAL FEES & TIMELINE

### License Renewal Timeline

[FACT - STATUTE] Per Ala. Code § 34-24-337:
- **Renewal Period:** October 1 - December 31 (3-month window)
- **Renewal Deadline:** December 31 (midnight)
- **Renewal Cycle:** Annual

[FACT - STATUTE] Licenses expire **December 31 of each year** and remain valid through that date.

### Renewal Fee Structure

[CRITICAL GAP] Specific renewal fee amounts are not documented in statute or publicly available board materials reviewed.

[FACT - STATUTE] Per statute, the Medical Licensure Commission (a separate entity from the Board) sets renewal fees, which may vary. Fees are adjusted periodically.

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] Renewal fees are likely available on the Licensee Gateway portal or by contacting the board directly.

### Late Renewal Fee

[FACT - STATUTE] Per Ala. Code § 34-24-337: Physicians renewing during the grace period (January 1-31) must pay:
- Standard renewal fee
- Late fee: **not to exceed $200** (amount determined by the Medical Licensure Commission)

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] The actual late fee amount is set by the Medical Licensure Commission and should be available on the Licensee Gateway.

### Reinstatement After January 31

[FACT - STATUTE] If a physician fails to renew by January 31, the license lapses and the physician must file a formal **reinstatement application** rather than a routine renewal.

---

## LAPSED LICENSE REINSTATEMENT

### Reinstatement Application and Requirements

[FACT - BOARD] Physicians with lapsed (expired) licenses must complete:
1. Formal Reinstatement Application
2. Payment of reinstatement fee (prorated fee, higher than routine renewal)
3. Criminal background check (additional $65 fee)
4. CME documentation (if required)

### CME Requirements for Reinstatement

[FACT - BOARD] Per board materials: Applicants for reinstatement are required to submit **25 AMA PRA Category 1 CME credits from the previous 12 months** of application.

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] Reinstatement requires proof of 25 hours of current CME (within the prior 12 months), ensuring physicians reinstate with current knowledge.

### Grace Period Reinstatement (January 1-31)

[FACT - STATUTE] If a physician allows license to lapse but renews during the grace period (January 1-31), they can renew rather than reinstate by:
- Submitting a renewal application (rather than reinstatement)
- Paying the standard renewal fee plus late fee (up to $200)
- Attesting to CME completion from the prior calendar year

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] The grace period mechanism allows for simpler renewal processing rather than formal reinstatement, minimizing burden on physicians who miss the December 31 deadline by just a few days.

### Formal Reinstatement (After January 31)

[FACT - STATUTE] If license lapses beyond January 31 grace period, physician must:
- File formal reinstatement application
- Provide criminal background check (at cost)
- Demonstrate 25 hours current CME from prior 12 months
- Pay reinstatement fee (likely higher than renewal fee)

[CRITICAL GAP] Specific reinstatement fee amounts are not documented. Contact board for current fee schedule.

---

## CME TRACKING SYSTEMS

### Self-Reporting Model

[FACT - STATUTE] Per statute, physicians are responsible for maintaining their own CME records and attesting to compliance during renewal.

[FACT - BOARD] The renewal form requires physicians to certify they have completed the required 25 hours of CME. Self-reporting is used unless the physician is selected for audit.

### Licensee Gateway Portal

[FACT - BOARD] The Licensee Gateway (accessible at https://www.albme.gov/licensing/md-do/licensing-md-do-license-renewals/) allows physicians to:
- Renew licenses online
- Upload CME documentation voluntarily
- Access renewal forms and resources

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] While CME documentation upload is encouraged, it is not mandatory unless the physician is selected for audit.

### No Mandatory Provider Reporting

[FACT - BOARD] Alabama does **not require** CME providers to automatically report completion to the board. Physicians are responsible for obtaining and maintaining documentation.

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] Unlike some states that use CE Broker or other automated tracking, Alabama relies on physician self-management and documentation.

### Accredited CME Providers

[FACT - BOARD] Acceptable CME providers include:
- Medical Association of the State of Alabama (state accreditor)
- ACCME-accredited providers (national accreditation)
- AAFP, ACOG, and other specialty organizations

[FACT - BOARD] The Alabama Board maintains a directory of accredited CME providers on its website.

### Documentation Retention

[FACT - ADMIN_CODE] Per Ala. Admin. Code r. 540-X-14: Physicians must maintain personal CME records for **3 years following the calendar year** in which the CME was earned.

[EXAMPLE] CME completed in 2026 must be retained through the end of 2029 (3 years after 2026).

---

## STATE-SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS

### Professional Boundaries CME as New Mandate (2025)

[FACT - BOARD] The professional boundaries CME requirement is a relatively new mandate (announced in 2024, effective in 2025) that represents Alabama's focus on ethics and professional conduct.

**Timeline:**
- Announcement: 2024
- Implementation: January 2025
- Deadline for existing licensees: December 31, 2025
- Ongoing for new licensees: Within 12 months of licensure

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] This requirement will be incorporated into standard renewal processes beginning in 2026, as most physicians will have completed it by the 2025 deadline.

### Unified Board Structure

[FACT - STATUTE] Alabama has a **unified medical board** that regulates both MD and DO physicians under the same licensure framework and CME requirements.

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] This simplifies regulation compared to split-board states. MD and DO physicians renew together, use the same portals, and have identical core CME requirements.

### Annual Calendar Year Renewal

[FACT - STATUTE] Unlike many states using biennial renewal cycles, Alabama uses a **strict calendar year renewal cycle** (December 31 deadline, January 1-December 31 CME accumulation).

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] This frequent renewal cycle (annual vs. biennial) keeps compliance fresh but requires more frequent contact with the board and CME participation year-round.

### Medical Association of the State of Alabama (MASA)

[FACT - BOARD] MASA serves as the state accreditor for CME in Alabama and works with ACCME.

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] Physicians should consult MASA website (https://www.alamedical.org/) for CME accreditation information and approved courses.

## RESEARCHER NOTES

Alabama presents a straightforward TIER-1 state with simple, annual CME requirements. The introduction of the professional boundaries CME requirement in 2025 represents the most significant recent change to Alabama's CME framework.

**Key Findings:**
1. Annual calendar-year renewal (not biennial) requires frequent board contact
2. No carryover of CME credits between years (strict annual accounting)
3. Grace period mechanism provides some flexibility for missed deadlines
4. Professional boundaries CME is a one-time requirement for existing licensees (deadline Dec 31, 2025)
5. Unified board simplifies administration compared to split-board states

**Notable Aspects:**
- Alabama does not allow CME carryover, creating a strict annual requirement
- Professional boundaries course provided free by board
- Board certification (ABMS/MOC) recognized but exemption scope unclear
- Annual audits provide accountability without burdensome documentation submission at renewal

**Recommendations for Physicians:**
- Complete professional boundaries CME well before December 31, 2025 deadline
- Maintain organized CME records (3-year retention requirement)
- If board-certified, clarify with board whether MOC fully satisfies CME requirement
- Track calendar-year CME accumulation to prevent accidental shortfalls
- Use Licensee Gateway to upload CME documentation proactively
