---

## 1. Board Information & Regulatory Authority

### Official Board Information

[FACT - BOARD] The New York State Education Department - Office of the Professions (NYSED-OP) is the official regulatory agency for physicians in New York. Website: https://www.op.nysed.gov. Phone: (518) 474-3817. (Accessed 2026-01-02)

[FACT - STATUTE] NYSED-OP's authority derives from New York Education Law Article 131 (Medicine).

### Primary Statutory Framework

[FACT - STATUTE] New York Education Law Article 131 establishes licensing and registration requirements for physicians.

[FACT - STATUTE] CME topic-specific requirements derive from:
- New York Social Services Law § 413 (Child Abuse Training)
- New York Public Health Law § 3309 (Infection Control)
- New York Education Law § 6527 (Pain Management/Palliative Care)

---

## 2. Registration Cycle & Structure

### Unique New York Registration System

[FACT - STATUTE] New York physicians receive a **lifetime medical license** but must **register periodically** to practice in New York State.

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] This is distinct from states that issue time-limited licenses requiring renewal. In New York, the license itself never expires, but the registration to practice expires.

### Biennial Registration (Every 2 Years)

[FACT - STATUTE] Physicians must register every **2 years (biennial)**, unlike most professions in New York which register triennially (every 3 years).

[FACT - BOARD] Registration periods are aligned with the physician's **birth month** to distribute renewals throughout the year.

[FACT - BOARD] Initial registration after licensure includes a transitional period of 1-2 years to align the registration cycle with the physician's birth month.

### Registration Timeline

[FACT - BOARD] The Office of Professions mails registration renewal notices approximately **4 months before registration expires**.

[FACT - BOARD] Registration fee: **$600** (biennial).

---

## 3. CME Requirements - NO SET Total Hours

### New York's Unique Approach: No Total Hour Requirement

[FACT - STATUTE] **New York does NOT require a set total number of CME hours for physicians.** Instead, New York mandates specific topic-based training requirements with varying timelines.

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] New York is one of only **4 states** with no total CME hour requirement (NY, IN, MT, SD). This creates a fundamentally different compliance structure than most states.

### Comparison with Other States

| State | Total Hours | Structure |
|-------|-------------|-----------|
| **New York** | **NO SET HOURS** | **Topic-specific only** |
| Texas | 48 hrs/2yr | Total hours + topics |
| Illinois | 150 hrs/3yr | Total hours + topics |
| Most States | 40-60 hrs/2yr | Total hours ± topics |

---

## 4. Topic-Specific CME Requirements

### Topic 1: Child Abuse Identification & Reporting (2 hours, one-time + 2025 update)

[FACT - STATUTE] All physicians must complete **2 hours of training on identifying and reporting child abuse and maltreatment**. This is a **one-time requirement** - once completed, it does not need to be repeated.

[FACT - STATUTE] **CRITICAL UPDATE - Chapter 56 of the Laws of 2021:** All mandated reporters who have previously completed child abuse training must complete an **updated curriculum by April 1, 2025**. The updated curriculum includes:
- Protocols to reduce **implicit bias** in decision-making
- Strategies for identifying **adverse childhood experiences (ACEs)**
- Guidelines for recognizing signs of abuse or maltreatment while interacting **virtually**

(Source: New York Social Services Law § 413; Chapter 56 of the Laws of 2021)

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] As of the research date (January 2, 2026), the April 1, 2025 deadline has **PASSED**. Physicians who previously completed child abuse training should have completed the updated curriculum by this date. New physicians completing the training for the first time after April 2025 should complete the updated version.

**Training Providers:** State Education Department maintains a list of SED-accredited providers offering the updated training, including Elite Learning, CEUFast, ATrain Education, Wild Iris Medical Education, and others.

### Topic 2: Infection Control & Barrier Precautions (Every 4 years)

[FACT - STATUTE] All physicians must complete **coursework or training on infection control and barrier precautions once every 4 years**.

(Source: New York Public Health Law § 3309)

[CRITICAL GAP] The statute does not specify the number of hours required for infection control training. This should be clarified with NYSED-OP.

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] The 4-year cycle is independent of the 2-year registration cycle. Physicians must track this separately - one infection control training satisfies two registration cycles.

### Topic 3: Pain Management, Palliative Care & Addiction (3 hours, every 3 years, DEA prescribers only)

[FACT - STATUTE] Physicians who hold a **DEA registration number to prescribe controlled substances** must complete **at least 3 hours of coursework or training in pain management, palliative care, and addiction** every **3 years**.

[FACT - STATUTE] This requirement also applies to **medical residents who prescribe controlled substances under a facility DEA registration number**.

(Source: New York Education Law § 6527)

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] This is a conditional requirement. Physicians without DEA registration are NOT required to complete pain management CME.

[CRITICAL - TIMING COMPLEXITY] The 3-year pain management cycle is different from both the 2-year registration cycle and the 4-year infection control cycle. DEA-registered physicians must track three separate timelines:
- 2-year registration renewal
- 3-year pain management CME
- 4-year infection control CME

### Topic 4: Federal DEA MATE Act Requirement (8 hours, one-time, separate from state)

[FACT - STATUTE] The federal **Medication Access and Training Expansion (MATE) Act** (effective June 27, 2023) requires physicians applying for or renewing DEA registration to complete **8 hours of training on opioid or substance use disorders** (one-time).

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] This is a **federal requirement**, separate from New York's 3-hour pain management state requirement. The 8-hour MATE Act training does NOT satisfy the 3-hour New York requirement (and vice versa).

## 5. Summary of All CME Requirements & Timelines

| Requirement | Hours | Frequency | Applicability | Deadline Notes |
|-------------|-------|-----------|---------------|----------------|
| **Child Abuse Training** | 2 hrs | One-time | All physicians | Initial + Updated by April 1, 2025 |
| **Infection Control** | Not specified | Every 4 years | All physicians | Cycle independent of registration |
| **Pain Management** | 3 hrs | Every 3 years | DEA prescribers only | Cycle independent of registration |
| **Federal MATE Act** | 8 hrs | One-time (at DEA renewal) | DEA applicants/renewals | Federal requirement |

---

## 6. Regulatory Timeline & Effective Dates

### Chronological History of New York CME Requirements

**Timeline of New York MD CME Regulatory Changes:**

| Date | Requirement | Status | Reference |
|------|-------------|--------|-----------|
| (Longstanding) | Child abuse training (2 hrs, one-time) | ESTABLISHED | Social Services Law § 413 |
| (Longstanding) | Infection control (every 4 yrs) | ESTABLISHED | Public Health Law § 3309 |
| (Longstanding) | Pain management (3 hrs/3yr, DEA only) | ESTABLISHED | Education Law § 6527 |
| June 27, 2023 | Federal MATE Act (8 hrs, one-time DEA) | EFFECTIVE | Federal law |
| 2021 (Ch. 56) | Updated child abuse training requirement | ENACTED | Chapter 56 Laws of 2021 |
| **April 1, 2025** | **Deadline for updated child abuse training** | **DEADLINE PASSED** | **All previously trained physicians** |
| September 1, 2025 | Further updated child abuse curriculum available | ONGOING | Approved providers |

[FACT - STATUTE] The April 1, 2025 deadline for updated child abuse training was a one-time transition requirement for all physicians who completed the original training prior to the 2021 update.

**Current Compliance Expectation (as of 2026-01-02):**
- All physicians: Child abuse training (2 hrs, updated version if first-time after April 2025)
- All physicians: Infection control (every 4 years)
- DEA prescribers: Pain management (3 hrs every 3 years)
- DEA applicants/renewals: Federal MATE Act (8 hrs one-time)
- Biennial registration: $600 every 2 years

---

## 7. Exemptions & Special Circumstances

### No General CME Exemptions Found

[CRITICAL - NO EXEMPTIONS] Research found NO exemptions in statute for:
- Board certification (ABMS, AOA, etc.)
- Retirement status
- Military service
- Hardship/medical conditions

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] New York's topic-specific structure (no total hours) means exemptions would need to be topic-specific. No such exemptions were identified.

[CRITICAL GAP] Board certification exemptions, if any, should be verified with NYSED-OP.

---

## 8. Registration Procedures & Fees

### Standard Registration Renewal Process

[FACT - BOARD] Physicians register through the New York State Education Department Office of the Professions online portal.

[FACT - BOARD] Renewal notices mailed 4 months before expiration.

[FACT - BOARD] Online renewal requires the PIN included in the renewal notice.

### Registration Fees

[FACT - BOARD] Standard registration fee: **$600** (biennial, every 2 years).

[CRITICAL GAP] Late registration fees, grace periods, or penalties for delayed registration are not documented in accessible materials.

---

## 9. Compliance Verification & Audits

[CRITICAL GAP] The statute does not specify audit procedures or frequency for verifying CME/training compliance.

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] New York likely relies on attestation during registration, with random audits or complaint-triggered verification.

---

## 10. Research Gaps & Limitations

### Critical Gaps Identified

| Gap | Impact | Recommendation |
|-----|--------|-----------------|
| Infection control training hours (not specified) | Compliance clarity | Contact NYSED-OP |
| Late registration fees/grace period | Delayed registration planning | Contact NYSED-OP |
| Board certification exemptions (not found) | Exemption availability | Contact NYSED-OP |
| Audit procedures & frequency (not published) | Audit risk | Contact NYSED-OP |
| Reinstatement procedures for expired registration | Lapsed registration | Contact NYSED-OP |
| Pain management 3-year cycle start date calculation | Compliance timing | Contact NYSED-OP |
| Infection control 4-year cycle start date | Compliance timing | Contact NYSED-OP |

### Cross-Source Congruency

**Verification Against FSMB Data:**
- FSMB reports: "No set CME hours" ✅ **MATCHES statute**
- FSMB reports: "2 hrs child abuse/maltreatment (one-time)" ✅ **MATCHES statute** (+ April 2025 update requirement)
- FSMB reports: "Infection control every 4 yrs" ✅ **MATCHES statute**
- FSMB reports: "3 hrs pain management/addiction if prescribes" ✅ **MATCHES statute**

**Congruency Assessment:** FSMB data aligns with New York statute. FSMB data does not reflect the April 2025 updated child abuse training deadline.

## Conclusion

New York MD registration requirements are **unique and complex** (TIER 3) due to the NO SET total CME hours structure, relying instead on topic-specific requirements with varying timelines.

**Core Requirements Summary:**
- NO total CME hours required
- Topic-specific: Child abuse (2 hrs one-time + April 2025 update), infection control (every 4 yrs), pain management (3 hrs/3yr DEA only)
- Biennial registration (every 2 years, birth month)
- $600 registration fee
- April 1, 2025 deadline for updated child abuse training (PASSED as of research date)

**Key Complexity Factors:**
1. No total hours creates unique tracking challenge
2. Multiple overlapping cycles (2-year registration, 3-year pain mgmt, 4-year infection control)
3. One-time + recurring requirements mixed
4. April 2025 update deadline for all previously trained physicians
5. Conditional DEA prescriber requirements

**For Physician Compliance:** Track three separate cycles: biennial registration, 3-year pain management (if DEA), 4-year infection control. Ensure updated child abuse training completed (April 2025 deadline). Register online 4 months before expiration.

**For Rules Engine Implementation:** Main challenge is tracking multiple independent cycles (2/3/4 years) without a total hour accumulator. System must track last completion date for each topic independently and calculate next due date based on topic-specific cycle length.
