## 1. Board Information & Regulatory Authority

### Official Board Information

[FACT - BOARD] The Tennessee Board of Medical Examiners is the official regulatory agency for allopathic physicians in Tennessee. Website: https://www.tn.gov/health/health-program-areas/health-professional-boards/me-board.html. Phone: (615) 532-4384. Email: Medical.Health@tn.gov. Address: 665 Mainstream Drive, Nashville, Tennessee 37243-0001. (Accessed 2026-01-02)

[FACT - STATUTE] The board's authority derives from Tennessee Code Annotated § 63-6-201 et seq., which establishes the board's powers and duties related to licensing and regulation of physicians.

### Primary Statutory Framework

[FACT - STATUTE] Tennessee Code Annotated § 63-6-210 is the primary statute governing license renewal, continuing medical education, retirement, and inactive status. Full citation: Tenn. Code Ann. § 63-6-210 (Renewal of licenses, retirement, and inactive status). Source: https://law.justia.com/codes/tennessee/

[FACT - STATUTE] Tennessee Code Annotated § 63-1-402 governs prescriber requirements for controlled substance education. Full citation: Tenn. Code Ann. § 63-1-402 (Prescribers required to hold current federal DEA license; controlled substance education).

[FACT - ADMIN_CODE] Tennessee Comprehensive Rules and Regulations 0880-02-.19 provides detailed requirements for continuing medical education. Citation: Tenn. Comp. R. & Regs. 0880-02-.19 (Continuing Medical Education). Source: https://publications.tnsosfiles.com/rules/0880/0880-02.20250617.pdf

### Split-Board State Identification

[FACT - STATUTE] Tennessee maintains separate regulatory boards for MD and DO physicians:
- **Tennessee Board of Medical Examiners** (Tenn. Code Ann. § 63-6-201 et seq.) regulates allopathic physicians (MDs)
- **Tennessee Board of Osteopathic Examination** (separate statutory authority) regulates osteopathic physicians (DOs)

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] This is a SPLIT-BOARD STATE. Tennessee Board of Medical Examiners website lists separate links for MD and DO licensing. The two boards are statutorily distinct entities with different CME requirements and procedures.

---

## 2. Lifecycle Phases & Grace Periods

### Standard Renewal Timeline

[FACT - STATUTE] Tennessee medical licenses are renewed on a biennial (2-year) cycle. Licenses expire on the last day of the last month of the licensee's renewal cycle, which corresponds to the licensee's birth month and whether they were born in an even or odd year. Tenn. Code Ann. § 63-6-210(a).

[FACT - BOARD] Renewal applications are sent by the board in advance of the scheduled renewal date. Physicians are responsible for submitting renewal applications and CME documentation prior to license expiration. (https://www.tn.gov/health/health-program-areas/health-professional-boards/me-board/me-board/continuing-education.html, accessed 2026-01-02)

### Grace Period & Late Renewal Window

[FACT - STATUTE] Physicians may renew within a 60-day grace period after license expiration without further notice or hearing. During this grace period, a $50 monthly late fee accrues in addition to the standard renewal fee. Tenn. Code Ann. § 63-6-210(a).

[FACT - STATUTE] If renewal is not completed within 60 days of license expiration, the license is **automatically revoked** without further notice or hearing. No reinstatement option is available unless strict reinstatement criteria are met. Tenn. Code Ann. § 63-6-210(a).

### License Expiration & Revocation

[FACT - STATUTE] Upon automatic revocation (more than 60 days after expiration), the license is permanently revoked. The physician cannot practice medicine in Tennessee with a revoked license. Tenn. Code Ann. § 63-6-210(a).

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] Tennessee's grace period (60 days) is more generous than Arizona (30 days free, 120 days total), but the consequence of missing the grace period is more severe (automatic revocation without hearing vs. expired license).

---

## 3. CME Requirements - Total Hours & Categories

### Total CME Hours Required

[FACT - STATUTE] Tennessee requires 40 credit hours of continuing medical education every 2 years (biennial renewal cycle). Tenn. Code Ann. § 63-6-210(b)(2)(i).

[FACT - ADMIN_CODE] All 40 hours must be AMA PRA Category 1 Credit™ or acceptable equivalent credit from ACCME-accredited providers, AAFP-accredited providers, or AOA-accredited providers. Tenn. Comp. R. & Regs. 0880-02-.19(1).

### CME Category Specification

[FACT - STATUTE] Acceptable CME includes:
- AMA PRA Category 1 Credit™
- AAFP equivalent credit designation
- AOA equivalent credit designation
- All from accredited providers

Tenn. Code Ann. § 63-6-210(b)(2)(i)

[FACT - ADMIN_CODE] CME providers must be ACCME-accredited, AAFP-accredited, or AOA-accredited to qualify. Tenn. Comp. R. & Regs. 0880-02-.19(1).

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] Tennessee accepts CME from multiple accreditation bodies (ACCME, AAFP, AOA), providing more flexibility than Arizona (ACCME only for MDs).

### Flexibility in CME Timing

[FACT - BOARD] Physicians may complete all or none of their required 40 hours in a single calendar year within the two-year CME cycle, as long as 40 total hours are completed within the appropriate two-year timeframe. (https://www.tn.gov/health/health-program-areas/health-professional-boards/me-board/me-board/continuing-education.html, accessed 2026-01-02)

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] This allows flexibility in CME scheduling within the 2-year renewal cycle, unlike states that require specific annual minimums.

---

## 4. CME Topic Requirements

### Mandatory Controlled Substance Prescribing CME

[FACT - STATUTE] All physicians must complete 2 hours of instruction in controlled substance prescribing as part of their required CME. This 2-hour requirement is part of the 40-hour total (not in addition to). Tenn. Code Ann. § 63-6-210(b)(2)(i).

[FACT - STATUTE] The 2-hour controlled substance CME must include instruction in Tennessee Department of Health treatment guidelines on:
- Opioids
- Benzodiazepines
- Barbiturates
- Carisoprodol
- Addiction medicine and risk management tools
- Other topics approved by the Board

Tenn. Code Ann. § 63-1-402

[FACT - STATUTE] This controlled substance CME requirement is mandatory for all physicians, not just those with DEA registration. Tenn. Code Ann. § 63-1-402.

### DEA MATE Act Training (8 Hours, One-Time)

[FACT - STATUTE] In addition to the biennial 40-hour CME requirement, all DEA-registered practitioners must complete an 8-hour one-time training on opioid use disorder and substance use disorder treatment and management. This requirement is separate from and in addition to the biennial 40-hour CME cycle. Effective date: June 27, 2023. Tenn. Code Ann. § 63-1-402.

[FACT - STATUTE] The 8-hour MATE Act training can be completed in cumulative fashion (does not need to be completed in one continuous session) and only needs to be completed once. Tenn. Code Ann. § 63-1-402.

### MATE Act Exemptions

[FACT - STATUTE] Physicians are exempt from the 8-hour MATE Act requirement if:
1. They graduated from a U.S. medical school within 5 years of June 27, 2023, AND completed a comprehensive curriculum with at least 8 hours of opioid/substance use disorder training as part of their medical school education, OR
2. They are board-certified in Addiction Medicine or Addiction Psychiatry

Tenn. Code Ann. § 63-1-402

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] This creates a one-time training burden for DEA registrants, but provides exemptions for new graduates with adequate training and specialists.

### Other Mandatory CME Topics

[CRITICAL GAP] The statute and administrative code do not specify other mandatory CME topics beyond the 2-hour controlled substance prescribing requirement and the 8-hour MATE Act training for DEA registrants. No requirements found for cultural competency, physician wellness, or other common mandatory topics. Tennessee appears to have minimal topic-specific mandates.

---

## 5. Controlled Substance Context

### Controlled Substance Education Requirement

[FACT - STATUTE] Tennessee Code Annotated § 63-1-402 requires all physicians holding current federal DEA licenses to complete and maintain controlled substance education credentials. This requirement applies to all prescribers. Tenn. Code Ann. § 63-1-402.

[FACT - STATUTE] The 2-hour controlled substance prescribing CME requirement (part of the 40-hour biennial total) must address Tennessee Department of Health treatment guidelines on opioids, benzodiazepines, barbiturates, carisoprodol, and addiction medicine.

### PDMP (Prescription Drug Monitoring Program)

[CRITICAL GAP] The statute and administrative code reference PDMP training as an approved topic for controlled substance CME but do not mandate specific PDMP training hours. Tennessee appears not to require dedicated PDMP training hours, though the topic is approved for CME credit.

### Opioid Prescribing Context

[FACT - STATUTE] Tennessee requires the 2-hour controlled substance prescribing CME to include instruction on opioid treatment guidelines and addiction management. This reflects Tennessee's public health focus on the opioid crisis. Tenn. Code Ann. § 63-1-402.

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] The 2-hour requirement and MATE Act training together create significant emphasis on opioid and substance use disorder management in Tennessee's CME framework.

### DEA Registration Requirement

[FACT - STATUTE] Tennessee Code Annotated § 63-1-402 requires all prescribers to hold a current federal DEA license. This is a licensing condition, not an optional credential. Tenn. Code Ann. § 63-1-402.

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] The mandatory DEA requirement means all Tennessee physicians authorized to prescribe must complete the 8-hour MATE Act training (unless exempt).

---

## 6. Audit & Verification Procedures

### Audit Discretion

[FACT - STATUTE] Audits are conducted at the discretion of the Tennessee Board of Medical Examiners. The board determines which licensees are selected for audit. Tenn. Code Ann. § 63-6-210(b)(2)(iii).

[CRITICAL GAP] The statute does not specify an audit percentage (e.g., 10% annually, random selection percentage, etc.). Audit selection appears to be fully discretionary with the board.

### Documentation Requirements

[FACT - STATUTE] Continuing education documentation is only required when an official Board audit notice is received. At that point, licensees must submit proof of CME completion. Tenn. Code Ann. § 63-6-210(b)(2)(iii).

[FACT - STATUTE] All licensees must retain independent documentation for **4 years from the end of the calendar year** in which the CME was acquired. Documentation must be available for Board inspection if audited. Tenn. Code Ann. § 63-6-210(b)(2)(iii).

### CE Broker Integration

[FACT - BOARD] Tennessee provides all licensees with a free Basic Account in CE Broker. If a licensee is selected for audit and is current in CE Broker, they automatically pass. (https://www.tn.gov/health/health-program-areas/health-professional-boards/me-board/me-board/continuing-education.html, accessed 2026-01-02)

[FACT - BOARD] CE Broker maintains a list of all reported continuing education courses. Licensees can verify their compliance status through CE Broker's "CE Compliance Status" feature, which lists all reported courses and renewal requirement status. (https://www.tn.gov/health/health-program-areas/health-professional-boards/me-board/me-board/continuing-education.html, accessed 2026-01-02)

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] CE Broker integration significantly reduces audit burden for compliant licensees—current CE Broker records constitute automatic audit passage.

### Acceptable Audit Documentation

[FACT - STATUTE] Acceptable documentation of CME compliance includes:
- Certificates or letters from course providers
- AAFP records
- CE Broker records
- Any other evidence of course completion

Tenn. Code Ann. § 63-6-210(b)(2)(iii)

### ACCME Pilot Program

[FACT - BOARD] Tennessee participates in a voluntary pilot program with ACCME where CME providers may report physician participation directly to the Board, bypassing the need for manual documentation. (https://www.accme.org/highlights/accme-and-board-medical-examiners-tennessee-collaborate-pilot-program-facilitate-reporting, accessed 2026-01-02)

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] This voluntary reporting program further streamlines CME documentation for participating providers.

---

## 7. Exemptions & Alternatives

### Board Certification Exemption (Partial)

[FACT - STATUTE] Physicians board-certified by ABMS, AOA, or American Board of Physician Specialties in ANY of the following specialties are EXEMPT from the 2-hour controlled substance prescribing CME requirement:
- Pain Management
- Anesthesiology
- Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation
- Neurology
- Rheumatology

Tenn. Code Ann. § 63-6-210(b)(2)(i)

[FACT - STATUTE] This exemption applies ONLY to the 2-hour controlled substance prescribing CME. These physicians must still complete 38 additional hours to meet the total 40-hour biennial requirement. Tenn. Code Ann. § 63-6-210(b)(2)(i).

[FACT - STATUTE] Board certification in these specialties does NOT exempt physicians from the 8-hour MATE Act requirement for DEA registration renewal. The MATE Act exemption applies only to addiction medicine or addiction psychiatry board certification. Tenn. Code Ann. § 63-1-402.

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] Specialists in pain management and related fields get partial relief (exemption from 2-hour requirement) but not full relief from the 40-hour total.

### New Graduate Exemption

[FACT - STATUTE] Physicians obtaining licensure in the same calendar year as successful completion of USMLE Step 3 are exempt from CME requirements for that calendar year only. Tenn. Code Ann. § 63-6-210(b)(2)(i).

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] This exemption applies only to the first calendar year of licensure, not the entire first renewal cycle.

### Waivers and Modifications

[FACT - STATUTE] The Board may waive or modify CME requirements in cases of:
- Retirement
- Illness or disability
- Other undue hardship

Tenn. Code Ann. § 63-6-210(b)(2)(ii)

[FACT - STATUTE] Waiver requests must be submitted in writing **before the license expiration date**. Requests submitted after expiration may not be considered. Tenn. Code Ann. § 63-6-210(b)(2)(ii).

[CRITICAL GAP] The statute does not specify what constitutes "undue hardship" or provide detailed waiver criteria. The board's standard for granting waivers should be clarified.

---

## 8. CME Tracking Systems

### Official Tracking System - CE Broker

[FACT - BOARD] Tennessee partners with CE Broker to provide free Basic Accounts to all licensees. CE Broker is the primary CME tracking system for Tennessee. (https://www.tn.gov/health/health-program-areas/health-professional-boards/me-board/me-board/continuing-education.html, accessed 2026-01-02)

**CE Broker Features:**
- Account creation (free for Tennessee licensees)
- Course search filtering by state, topic, provider, and credit hours
- Automatic import of courses reported by CME providers
- CME transcript generation
- CE Compliance Status report showing all reported courses and renewal requirement status
- Mobile app tracking
- Customer support: 877-434-6323

### Reporting Methods

[FACT - BOARD] CME hours are reported to CE Broker through multiple methods:
1. **Direct Provider Reporting** - ACCME, AAFP, and AOA providers can report directly to CE Broker
2. **ACCME Pilot Program** - Some providers report directly to Board
3. **Physician Self-Reporting** - Licensees can manually enter CME courses
4. **Certificate Import** - Courses can be documented through uploaded certificates

(https://www.tn.gov/health/health-program-areas/health-professional-boards/me-board/me-board/continuing-education.html, accessed 2026-01-02)

### Renewal Portal

[FACT - BOARD] Physicians renew licenses through the online Health Licensure Regulation System (HLRS) at https://apps.tn.gov/hlrs/. The portal allows:
- Online renewal application submission
- CME hours verification
- Fee payment
- License status verification

(https://apps.tn.gov/hlrs/, accessed 2026-01-02)

### Document Retention

[FACT - STATUTE] All licensees must retain independent documentation for **4 years from the end of the calendar year** in which CME was acquired. Documentation must be available for Board inspection if audited. Tenn. Code Ann. § 63-6-210(b)(2)(iii).

### Cycle Transition (Effective January 1, 2025)

[FACT - BOARD] As of January 1, 2025, licensees must submit proof for the "past licensure renewal cycle rather than the calendar year cycle." Prior to January 1, 2025, the board accepted CMEs from either calendar-year or renewal-cycle formats. (https://www.tn.gov/health/health-program-areas/health-professional-boards/me-board/me-board/continuing-education.html, accessed 2026-01-02)

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] This change standardizes the CME tracking year to align with the individual licensee's renewal cycle rather than the calendar year, reducing confusion and errors.

---

## 9. Lapsed License Reinstatement

### Grace Period & Administrative Revocation

[FACT - STATUTE] Physicians may renew within 60 days after license expiration by paying renewal fees and any accrued late penalties ($50 per month). If renewal is not completed within 60 days, the license is automatically revoked without further notice or hearing. Tenn. Code Ann. § 63-6-210(a).

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] The 60-day grace period provides reasonable opportunity for renewal, but the consequence (automatic revocation) is severe.

### Reinstatement Requirements (If Lapsed)

[FACT - STATUTE] If a license has been revoked for non-renewal (lapsed more than 60 days), reinstatement requires:
1. Proof of completion of all required continuing education during the time the license was inactive
2. Results of criminal background check from a board-specified vendor
3. Any additional requirements requested by the Board to ensure continued competency
4. Payment of all past-due renewal fees
5. Payment of reinstatement fees as established by the Board

Tenn. Code Ann. § 63-6-210(c)

[FACT - STATUTE] If the license has been inactive/expired for **more than 5 years**, the applicant must **reapply for licensure** as a new application rather than seeking reinstatement. Full relicensing requirements apply. Tenn. Code Ann. § 63-6-210(c).

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] Tennessee provides a reinstatement pathway for lapsed licenses but with a 5-year limit. After 5 years of inactivity, physicians must reapply for licensure from scratch.

### Reinstatement Timeline

[CRITICAL GAP] The statute does not specify a timeline for processing reinstatement applications. Reinstatement timeline should be clarified with the board.

---

## 10. Renewal Fees & Timeline

### Fee Structure

[FACT - STATUTE] The standard renewal fee is $215 (as noted in board materials, though statute may be subject to board-adopted fee adjustments). Tenn. Code Ann. § 63-6-210(a).

[FACT - STATUTE] A $50 monthly late fee accrues during the 60-day grace period for renewals completed after license expiration. Tenn. Code Ann. § 63-6-210(a).

[FACT - STATUTE] The Board may impose additional late penalties not to exceed twice the renewal fee per month. Tenn. Code Ann. § 63-6-210(a).

### Renewal Timeline

[FACT - STATUTE] Licenses are valid for 24 months (biennial) and expire on the last day of the last month of the licensee's renewal cycle. Renewal applications are sent by the board in advance of the scheduled renewal date. Tenn. Code Ann. § 63-6-210(a).

[FACT - STATUTE] Licenses are assigned to renewal cycles based on the licensee's birth month and whether they were born in an even or odd year, creating varied renewal dates across the physician population. Tenn. Code Ann. § 63-6-210(a).

[FACT - BOARD] Physicians are responsible for submitting renewal applications prior to the license expiration date. The board recommends early submission to ensure processing before expiration. (https://www.tn.gov/health/health-program-areas/health-professional-boards/me-board/me-board/continuing-education.html, accessed 2026-01-02)

### License Validity

[FACT - STATUTE] Upon successful renewal, the physician receives a license valid for 24 months (biennial renewal cycle) from the renewal date. Tenn. Code Ann. § 63-6-210(a).

---

## 11. State-Specific Requirements

### Interstate Medical Licensure Compact (IMLC) Participation

[FACT - BOARD] Tennessee participates in the Interstate Medical Licensure Compact, which provides streamlined licensure pathways for practice in multiple states. However, this does not change Tennessee's CME or renewal requirements. (https://www.tn.gov/health/health-program-areas/health-professional-boards/me-board.html, accessed 2026-01-02)

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] IMLC participation enhances portability but does not reduce Tennessee's own CME requirements.

### Retirement Status Option

[FACT - STATUTE] Physicians may voluntarily file for retirement status. Benefits include:
- No fee to retire
- Exempt from CME requirements once retired
- Cannot practice medicine with retired license

Tenn. Code Ann. § 63-6-210(d)

[CRITICAL GAP] The statute does not specify how to reactivate from retirement status or whether CME is required to reactivate. This should be clarified with the board.

### Inactive Status Option

[FACT - STATUTE] Physicians may request inactive status, which is created for physicians actively practicing in other states. Requirements include:
- Appropriate fee payment (amount not specified in statute)
- Board-established compliance requirements
- Exempt from CME requirements while inactive
- Cannot engage in active practice in Tennessee with inactive license

Tenn. Code Ann. § 63-6-210(d)

[CRITICAL GAP] The statute does not specify the fee for inactive status or the procedures for reactivation. These details should be clarified with the board.

### Controlled Substance Education (2-hour requirement)

[FACT - STATUTE] Tennessee requires all physicians to complete 2 hours of controlled substance prescribing CME, with specific focus on Tennessee Department of Health treatment guidelines. This is a unique state-specific focus. Tenn. Code Ann. § 63-1-402.

### DEA MATE Act Compliance

[FACT - STATUTE] Tennessee enforces the federal MATE Act requirement (8 hours one-time training for DEA registrants). This is a federal requirement with state enforcement. Tenn. Code Ann. § 63-1-402.

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] Tennessee actively enforces federal opioid-related training requirements.

**Confidence Level: HIGH**

The statute is clear and comprehensive for core requirements. Tennessee's rules are well-documented in the administrative code. The primary gaps are edge cases (waiver criteria, reactivation procedures) and discretionary practices (audit frequency) that do not affect the core requirement structure.

## Conclusion

Tennessee's MD license renewal requirements are clearly articulated in statute with some unique features:

1. **Controlled Substance CME (2 hours):** Mandatory for all physicians, focusing on Tennessee DOH treatment guidelines
2. **DEA MATE Act Training (8 hours):** One-time federal requirement for DEA registrants, with exemptions for new graduates with adequate training and addiction medicine specialists
3. **CE Broker Integration:** Free basic account provided by board with automatic audit passage if current
4. **60-Day Grace Period:** More generous than some states but with automatic revocation without hearing after expiration
5. **5-Year Reinstatement Limit:** Physicians can reinstate within 5 years of expiration, but must reapply as new applicants after 5 years
6. **Split-Board State:** Separate DO board with different requirements

**For Physician Compliance:** Track renewal date (biennial, based on birth month), complete 40 hours CME with 2 hours on controlled substance prescribing, complete 8-hour MATE Act training if DEA registered (one-time), and maintain CE Broker account to ensure automatic audit passage.

**For Rules Engine Implementation:** This state has clear, well-structured requirements. Primary implementation considerations are:
- Birth month-based renewal cycles (varied renewal dates)
- Conditional 8-hour MATE Act training (one-time for DEA registrants)
- Board certification partial exemption (2-hour requirement only)
- CE Broker integration for audit clearance
- 5-year limit on reinstatement before full reapplication required
