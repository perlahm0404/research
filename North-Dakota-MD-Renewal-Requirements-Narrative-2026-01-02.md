# North Dakota MD License Renewal Requirements - Narrative Research

**Research Period:** January 2, 2026
**Tier Classification:** TIER-1 (Simple State)
**Document Version:** 1.0
**Completion:** 86%

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

North Dakota requires physicians to complete 40 hours of CME per 2-year (biennial) renewal cycle with **all 40 hours required to be Category 1** (ACCME, AOA, or equivalent accreditation). The state is notable for having a **board certification exemption from CME audit** for physicians maintaining active ABMS, AOA, or Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada certification. North Dakota has **minimal mandatory topic requirements** and represents one of the simplest and most straightforward CME systems in the United States, making it exceptionally physician-friendly.

**Key Highlights:**
- **CME Requirement:** 40 hours per 2-year cycle (all Category 1 required)
- **Category 1 Requirement:** 100% Category 1 (stricter than most states)
- **No Mandatory Topics:** No specific topic requirements (exceptionally simple)
- **Board Certification Exemption:** ABMS/AOA/Royal College cert exemption from CME audit
- **Renewal Cycle:** Biennial (dates vary by licensee)
- **Complexity Score:** 2/10 (Simplest TIER-1 state with lowest hour requirement and no mandatory topics)

## CORE CME REQUIREMENTS

### Primary Requirement: 40 Hours Per 2-Year Cycle (All Category 1)

[FACT-STATUTE] North Dakota requires **40 hours of CME per 2-year renewal cycle** per North Dakota Century Code § 43-17-31.

[FACT-STATUTE] **All 40 hours must be Category 1** (ACCME, AOA, or equivalent accreditation). North Dakota does **not accept Category 2** credits for license renewal.

[FACT-STATUTE] This makes North Dakota one of the **lowest-hour states requiring 100% Category 1**, combining simplicity (low total hours) with quality standards (all accredited).

[FACT-STATUTE] CME must be from **accredited providers** (ACCME, AOA, AMA PRA, or other board-approved accrediting bodies).

[FACT-STATUTE] **No mandatory topic requirements:** North Dakota does not mandate specific topics (e.g., opioid prescribing, risk management, implicit bias), making it one of the simplest states for compliance.

---

## BOARD CERTIFICATION EXEMPTION FROM CME AUDIT

### Board Certification Exemption (Audit-Based)

[FACT-STATUTE] Physicians with **active board certification or Maintenance of Certification (MOC)** from ABMS, AOA, or Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada (RCPSC) are **exempt from CME audit** per North Dakota Administrative Code 50-02-04.

[FACT-STATUTE] The exemption applies if:
1. The physician holds **current, active certification** (not expired)
2. The physician is actively participating in a **Maintenance of Certification (MOC)** program or equivalent
3. The certification is from an **ABMS-recognized specialty board**, **AOA specialty board**, or **RCPSC**

[CRITICAL GAP] **Status:** Whether the exemption is:
- **Complete exemption from CME requirement** (no CME needed at all), OR
- **Exemption from audit only** (still must complete 40 hours but not audited)
is **unclear** in publicly available materials.

**Interpretation:** The language "exemption from CME audit" suggests physicians still complete CME but are **exempt from audit verification**, trusting that MOC participation ensures adequate continuing education.

**Next Step:** Board contact for clarification

[CRITICAL GAP] **Status:** Whether the exemption applies during the **entire certification validity period** or only during **years of active MOC participation** is unclear.
- **Interpretation:** "Board certification/MOC" suggests only during active participation
- **Next Step:** Board contact

[FACT-STATUTE] Physicians claiming this exemption must provide documentation of current certification status and active MOC participation at renewal.

## RENEWAL CYCLE & DEADLINES

### Renewal Schedule: Biennial (Individual Dates)

[FACT-STATUTE] North Dakota physicians renew **biennial** with renewal dates varying by individual licensee per North Dakota Century Code § 43-17-31.

[FACT-STATUTE] **Timeline:**
- Renewal cycle: **2 years**
- Renewal deadline: **Varies by licensee** (assigned at initial licensure)
- CME period: **40 hours Category 1 completed within the 2-year period ending on renewal date**

[CRITICAL GAP] **Status:** Grace period mechanics, late fees, and renewal fee amounts **not documented** in publicly available materials.
- **Next Step:** Board contact or online renewal portal review

### New Licensee Provisions

[CRITICAL GAP] **Status:** Whether new licensees have **reduced CME requirements** for their first renewal cycle **not documented**.
- **Assumption:** Likely pro-rated based on months licensed, but requires confirmation
- **Next Step:** Board contact

---

- **Specialty societies** with ACCME accreditation
- **Other accrediting bodies** approved by the North Dakota Board of Medicine

### Category 1 Only Requirement

[FACT-STATUTE] **All 40 hours must be Category 1:**
- North Dakota requires 100% Category 1 (ACCME or AOA accredited)

## CRITICAL GAPS & RESEARCH CHALLENGES

### Gap 1: Board Certification Exemption Scope

[CRITICAL GAP] **Status:** Whether the "exemption from CME audit" means:
- **Complete exemption** (no CME requirement at all), OR
- **Audit exemption only** (still must complete 40 hours but not audited)
is **unclear**.
- **Impact:** CRITICAL - fundamentally changes compliance obligation for board-certified physicians
- **Next Step:** Board contact for definitive answer

### Gap 2: Board Certification Exemption Duration

[CRITICAL GAP] **Status:** Whether the exemption applies during the **entire certification validity period** or only during **cycles with active MOC participation** is unclear.
- **Impact:** HIGH - affects board-certified physicians' ongoing compliance obligations
- **Next Step:** Board contact

### Gap 3: New Licensee Pro-Rata CME

[CRITICAL GAP] **Status:** Whether new licensees have **reduced CME requirements** for their first renewal cycle (e.g., pro-rated based on months licensed) **not documented**.
- **Assumption:** Likely pro-rated, but requires confirmation
- **Next Step:** Board contact

### Gap 4: Grace Period and Late Fees

[CRITICAL GAP] **Status:** Grace period duration, late fee amounts, and license expiration mechanics **not documented** in publicly available materials.
- **Next Step:** Online renewal portal review or board contact

### Gap 5: Opioid/Pain Management Requirements

[CRITICAL GAP] **Status:** Whether there are **any opioid prescribing or pain management CME requirements** (even for DEA registrants) **not documented**.
- **Interpretation:** No mandatory topics found in available materials, suggesting no opioid requirement
- **Next Step:** Board contact or statute review to confirm

### Gap 6: Specialty-Specific Requirements

[CRITICAL GAP] **Status:** Whether any specialties (e.g., pain management, addiction medicine) have **additional CME requirements beyond the base 40 hours** **not documented**.
- **Assumption:** Likely no specialty requirements based on available information
- **Next Step:** Board contact

| **North Dakota** | 40/2yr | 40 (100%) | None | 2/10 |
| Maryland | 50/2yr | 25 (50%) | Implicit bias (2 hrs one-time), CDS (2 hrs) | 3/10 |
| Delaware | 40/2yr | 40 (100%) | Controlled substances (2 hrs) | 3/10 |
| Hawaii | 40/2yr | 40 (100%) | None documented | 3/10 |
| Idaho | 40/2yr | 40 (100%) | None documented | 3/10 |
