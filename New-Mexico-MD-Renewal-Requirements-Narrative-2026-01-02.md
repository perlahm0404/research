## CORE CME REQUIREMENTS

### Primary Requirement: 75 Hours Per 3-Year Cycle (All Category 1)

[FACT-STATUTE] New Mexico requires **75 hours of CME per 3-year renewal cycle** per New Mexico Statutes § 61-6-15.

[FACT-STATUTE] **All 75 hours must be Category 1** (ACCME, AOA, or equivalent accreditation). New Mexico does **not accept Category 2** credits for license renewal.

[FACT-STATUTE] This makes New Mexico identical to Minnesota in terms of category strictness, requiring 100% accredited CME.

[FACT-STATUTE] CME must be from **accredited providers** (ACCME, AOA, AMA PRA, or other board-approved accrediting bodies).

### New Licensee DEA Requirement: 5 Hours Pain Management (First Year)

[FACT-STATUTE] **New licensees with DEA registration** must complete **5 hours of pain management CME in the first year of licensure** per 16.10.14 NMAC.

[FACT-STATUTE] This requirement applies to physicians who:
1. Are **newly licensed** in New Mexico (first-time licensure, not renewal)
2. Hold a **valid DEA registration** for prescribing controlled substances

[FACT-STATUTE] Pain management topics include:
- Safe opioid prescribing practices
- Recognition of substance use disorders
- Non-opioid pain management alternatives
- PDMP (Prescription Drug Monitoring Program) utilization
- Chronic pain management strategies
- CDC opioid prescribing guidelines

[FACT-STATUTE] This requirement is **one-time during the first year of licensure**, not repeated at renewal.

[CRITICAL GAP] **Status:** Whether this 5-hour requirement is **in addition to** the standard 75-hour triennial requirement or **included within** the first renewal cycle is unclear.
- **Interpretation:** Likely **in addition** since it's a first-year requirement before the first renewal, but requires confirmation
- **Next Step:** Board contact

[CRITICAL GAP] **Status:** Whether physicians without DEA registration have **any new licensee requirements** is not documented.
- **Assumption:** Likely no special requirement if no DEA, but requires confirmation

---

## BOARD CERTIFICATION EXEMPTION

### Active Board Certification Alternative

[FACT-STATUTE] Physicians with **active ABMS or ABMS-approved specialty board certification or recertification** during the renewal period are **exempt from CME requirements**.

[FACT-STATUTE] The exemption applies if:
1. The physician holds **current, active certification** (not expired)
2. The certification or recertification occurred **during the 3-year renewal period**
3. The certification is from an **ABMS-recognized specialty board** or **ABMS-approved board**

[FACT-STATUTE] Physicians claiming this exemption must provide documentation of current certification status or recertification completion during the renewal cycle.

[CRITICAL GAP] **Status:** Whether the exemption applies to **AOA board certification** (in addition to ABMS) is unclear.
- **User Info:** States "ABMS or ABMS-approved specialty board"
- **FSMB:** May also include AOA
- **Next Step:** Board contact for clarification on AOA recognition

[CRITICAL GAP] **Status:** Whether the exemption is **complete** (covering all CME requirements including new licensee pain management) or **partial** is unclear.
- **Assumption:** Likely complete exemption for renewal cycles, but new licensee requirement may still apply
- **Next Step:** Board contact

[CRITICAL GAP] **Status:** Whether the exemption applies during the **entire certification validity period** or only during **years of active recertification** is unclear.
- **Interpretation:** "During the renewal period" suggests only cycles containing certification/recertification activity
- **Next Step:** Board contact

## RENEWAL CYCLE & DEADLINES

### Renewal Schedule: Triennial (Individual Dates)

[FACT-STATUTE] New Mexico physicians renew **triennial** with renewal dates varying by individual licensee per New Mexico Statutes § 61-6-15.

[FACT-STATUTE] **Timeline:**
- Renewal cycle: **3 years**
- Renewal deadline: **Varies by licensee** (assigned at initial licensure)
- CME period: **75 hours Category 1 completed within the 3-year period ending on renewal date**

[CRITICAL GAP] **Status:** Grace period mechanics, late fees, and renewal fee amounts **not documented** in publicly available materials.
- **Next Step:** Board contact or online renewal portal review

### New Licensee Provisions

[FACT-STATUTE] New licensees with DEA registration have the **5-hour first-year pain management requirement** (detailed above).

[CRITICAL GAP] **Status:** Whether new licensees have **reduced base CME requirements** for their first renewal cycle (beyond the pain management requirement) **not documented**.
- **Assumption:** Likely pro-rated based on months licensed, but requires confirmation
- **Next Step:** Board contact

## KEY DISTINCTIONS & FEATURES

**New Mexico-Specific Characteristics:**

1. **Targeted New Licensee Requirement:** New Mexico's 5-hour pain management requirement specifically targets **new licensees with DEA registration** in their first year, reflecting a focus on safe prescribing from the start of practice.

2. **100% Category 1 Requirement:** New Mexico is one of the few states requiring **all 75 hours to be Category 1**, eliminating the flexibility of Category 2 self-directed learning. This makes New Mexico identical to Minnesota in strictness.

3. **Minimal Mandatory Topics:** Unlike Minnesota and Massachusetts (which have 9+ mandatory topics), New Mexico has **only the new licensee pain management requirement**, making it one of the simplest triennial states for ongoing compliance.

4. **Board Certification Recognition:** New Mexico recognizes ABMS and ABMS-approved specialty board certification as an alternative to CME requirements, acknowledging that certification/recertification programs provide rigorous continuing education.

5. **Individual Renewal Dates:** Unlike states with fixed renewal dates (e.g., December 31 or birth month), New Mexico assigns **individual renewal dates** at initial licensure.

6. **Complexity Score: 3/10** - New Mexico is a straightforward TIER-1 state with:
   - Simple base requirement (75 hours/3 years, all Category 1)
   - Only one targeted mandatory topic (new licensee pain management, DEA holders only)
   - Clear board certification exemption
   - Minimal specialty-specific requirements
   - Triennial cycle requires less frequent renewal than biennial states
