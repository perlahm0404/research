## 1. Board Information & Regulatory Authority

### Official Board Information

[FACT - BOARD] The Oregon Medical Board is the official regulatory agency for physicians in Oregon. Website: https://www.oregon.gov/omb. Phone: (971) 673-2700. (Standard research date: 2026-01-02)

[FACT - STATUTE] The Oregon Medical Board's authority derives from Oregon Revised Statutes § 677 et seq., which establishes the board's powers and duties related to licensing and regulation of physicians.

### Primary Statutory Framework

[FACT - STATUTE] Oregon Revised Statutes § 677.085 is the primary statute governing continuing medical education requirements for physicians. This section establishes the 60-hour CME requirement per biennial cycle with pro-rata provisions.

[FACT - STATUTE] Oregon Revised Statutes § 677.097 specifically addresses pain management education requirements.

[FACT - ADMIN_CODE] Oregon Administrative Rules 847-010-0055 provides detailed requirements for continuing medical education, including category requirements and mandatory topics.

[FACT - BOARD] Renewal portal: https://www.oregon.gov/omb/license-apps/pages/renew.aspx

### Unified Board Structure

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] Oregon operates a unified board for MD and DO physicians under a single board authority, though CME requirements may have subtle differences in category acceptance (AOA categories for DO physicians). This research document covers MD-specific requirements.

---

## 2. Renewal Cycle & Dates

### Biennial Renewal Schedule

[FACT - STATUTE] Oregon physicians renew their medical licenses every 24 months (biennial renewal cycle). ORS § 677.265.

[FACT - STATUTE] Oregon uses a **coordinated biennial renewal cycle** with specific renewal dates aligned across the state, rather than individual birth month or registration date renewals.

[CRITICAL GAP] The specific renewal dates or coordination mechanism (e.g., odd-year vs even-year, specific month) are not detailed in readily accessible materials. This should be clarified with the board.

### Pro-Rata Provision for Newly Licensed Physicians

[FACT - STATUTE] Physicians who are **licensed in the second year of a biennium** (after the halfway point of the 2-year cycle) are required to complete only **30 hours of CME** (50% of the standard 60-hour requirement) for their first renewal. ORS § 677.085.

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] This pro-rata provision reduces the burden on newly licensed physicians who have less than a full 2-year period to accumulate CME before their first renewal.

**Example:** If the biennium runs from Jan 1, 2025 to Dec 31, 2026:
- Physician licensed in 2025 (Year 1): Must complete **60 hours** by Dec 31, 2026
- Physician licensed in 2026 (Year 2): Must complete **30 hours** by Dec 31, 2026

[CRITICAL GAP] The exact definition of "second year of biennium" (e.g., after 12 months, after specific date) is not specified in accessible materials and should be verified with the board.

### Renewal Timeline & Submission Windows

[FACT - BOARD] Physicians may renew online through the Oregon Medical Board renewal portal.

[CRITICAL GAP] Specific renewal submission windows (e.g., 60-90 days before expiration) and grace period information are not documented in readily accessible board materials. This should be clarified with the board.

---

## 3. CME Requirements - Base Hours & Categories

### Total CME Hours Required

[FACT - STATUTE] Oregon requires **60 continuing medical education hours every 2 years (biennial cycle)**, or **30 hours if licensed in the second year of the biennium**. ORS § 677.085.

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] At 60 hours biennial, Oregon aligns with moderate-to-high CME requirements among states (higher than the common 40-50 hour biennial requirements but lower than states like New Hampshire at 100 hours or New Jersey at 100 hours).

### Category Requirements - All Category 1 or AOA 1A/2A

[FACT - STATUTE] All hours must be **AMA PRA Category 1 Credit** or **AOA Category 1A/2A Credit**. ORS § 677.085 and OAR 847-010-0055.

[FACT - STATUTE] Oregon does **NOT accept AMA PRA Category 2 Credit** or other informal self-study activities for CME compliance (except AOA Category 2A which is accepted).

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] Oregon's category requirement is restrictive for MDs (all Category 1), but provides flexibility for DO physicians (AOA 1A/2A accepted). This ensures all CME is formal, accredited education.

[CRITICAL CLARIFICATION] AOA Category 2A is accepted (despite "Category 2" designation), which may cause confusion. The key distinction:
- AMA Category 2 (self-study, no accreditation) = **NOT accepted**
- AOA Category 2A (accredited self-study with post-testing) = **Accepted**

### CME Categories & Formats

[FACT - STATUTE] Acceptable CME must be:
- **AMA PRA Category 1 Credit** from ACCME-accredited providers
- **AOA Category 1A Credit** (live programs, formal accredited education)
- **AOA Category 2A Credit** (enduring materials with post-testing, accredited)
- Live conferences, online courses with evaluation, enduring materials with assessment

(OAR 847-010-0055)

### Carryover of Excess CME Hours

[CRITICAL GAP] Research did not identify explicit carryover provisions in accessible statute or board materials. Whether excess CME hours can be carried forward to the next renewal period is unclear and should be verified with the board.

---

## 4. CME Topic Requirements - Mandatory Topics

### Overview of Mandatory Topics - Unique Pain Management Structure

[FACT - STATUTE] Oregon has a unique two-part pain management CME structure that differs from most states. All physicians must complete:

**Part 1:** 1 hour pain management (universal requirement)
**Part 2:** 6 hours pain management OR care of terminally ill/dying patients

Total pain-related CME: **7 hours** (1 + 6)

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] This structure provides flexibility - physicians can choose to focus on pain management (7 total hours) or split between pain management (1 hour) and end-of-life care (6 hours).

### Topic 1: Pain Management - Universal 1 Hour (All Licenses)

[FACT - STATUTE] All physicians must complete **1 hour of continuing education on pain management** during each biennial renewal period. ORS § 677.097.

[FACT - STATUTE] This 1-hour pain management requirement applies to **all licenses** regardless of DEA registration status or prescribing practices. ORS § 677.097.

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] Oregon's universal application (all licenses) is broader than many states that limit pain management CME to DEA registrants or controlled substance prescribers only.

### Topic 2: Pain Management OR Terminally Ill/Dying Patient Care - 6 Hours

[FACT - STATUTE] All physicians must complete **6 hours of continuing education** in either:
- **Pain management** (additional 6 hours beyond the 1-hour universal requirement)
- **Care of terminally ill or dying patients** (palliative care, hospice, end-of-life care)

(ORS § 677.097 and OAR 847-010-0055)

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] Physicians have flexibility to choose their focus:
- **Option A:** 7 hours total pain management (1 hr universal + 6 hrs pain)
- **Option B:** 1 hour pain management + 6 hours end-of-life care

[CRITICAL GAP] The statute does not clarify:
- Whether the 6 hours must be entirely in one category (all pain OR all end-of-life) or can be mixed (e.g., 3 hrs pain + 3 hrs end-of-life)
- Whether specific course content standards apply
- Whether these hours must be Category 1 or can be Category 2A (AOA)

These details should be verified with the board.

### Summary of Pain Management CME Structure

| Requirement | Hours | Applicability | Flexibility |
|-------------|-------|---------------|-------------|
| Pain management (universal) | 1 hr | All licenses | Mandatory |
| Pain management OR terminally ill/dying | 6 hrs | All licenses | Physician choice |
| **Total pain-related CME** | **7 hrs** | **All licenses** | **1 hr fixed + 6 hrs flexible** |

### Other Mandatory Topics - None Identified

[FACT - RESEARCH] Research identified no other state-wide mandatory CME topics beyond the pain management/end-of-life structure. Oregon does not appear to have general mandatory requirements for:
- Ethics or professionalism
- Human trafficking
- Implicit bias
- Cultural competency
- Controlled substance prescribing (beyond general pain management)

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] The absence of additional mandatory topics makes Oregon focused on pain management and end-of-life care as the primary regulatory priorities.

---

## 5. Exemptions & Special Circumstances

### Board Certification/MOC Alternative (ABMS or AOA-BOS)

[FACT - STATUTE] Physicians with **active board certification** or **Maintenance of Certification (MOC)** from **ABMS-approved boards** or **AOA Bureau of Osteopathic Specialists (AOA-BOS)** may use this as an alternative to the 60-hour CME requirement. ORS § 677.085.

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] This provision suggests that maintaining active board certification or participating in MOC programs may satisfy the CME requirement, but the exact scope and timing are unclear.

[CRITICAL GAP] The statute does not clarify:
- Whether MOC participation alone is sufficient or if recertification/exam is required
- How the timing aligns (MOC during the biennium vs at renewal)
- Whether the pain management 1+6 hour requirement is also exempted or must still be completed
- What documentation is required to prove board certification/MOC status

These details should be verified with the board.

### First-Time Renewal Pro-Rata Provision

[FACT - STATUTE] Physicians licensed in the **second year of a biennium** need only complete **30 hours CME** (50% of standard 60 hours) for their first renewal. ORS § 677.085.

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] This is a significant exemption/reduction for newly licensed physicians, cutting the requirement in half if licensed in the second year of the renewal cycle.

[CRITICAL GAP] Whether the pain management 1+6 hour requirement is also reduced proportionally (e.g., 0.5 + 3 = 3.5 hours) or remains at the full 7 hours is unclear and should be verified with the board.

### Retired or Inactive Physicians

[CRITICAL GAP] Exemptions for retired or inactive physician status are not documented in readily accessible materials. Physicians seeking retired status should contact the board directly.

---

## 6. CME Tracking & Compliance Verification

### CME Documentation Requirements

[FACT - STATUTE] Physicians must maintain documentation of CME completion and provide certificates upon request for audit or verification. OAR 847-010-0055.

[CRITICAL GAP] Specific documentation retention requirements (e.g., 2 years, 4 years, 6 years) are not detailed in readily accessible statute or board materials.

### Verification at Renewal

[FACT - BOARD] Physicians attest to CME compliance at renewal through the Oregon Medical Board renewal portal.

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] Oregon likely uses an attestation-based system at renewal with potential post-renewal audits, rather than requiring certificate upload at the time of renewal.

### Audit Procedures

[FACT - STATUTE] The Oregon Medical Board may audit CME compliance and request documentation. OAR 847-010-0055.

[CRITICAL GAP] The percentage or frequency of audits, whether audits are random or for-cause, and specific audit triggers are not published in readily accessible statute or board materials.

---

## 7. Renewal Procedures & Fees

### Standard Renewal Process

[FACT - BOARD] Physicians renew through the Oregon Medical Board renewal portal at https://www.oregon.gov/omb/license-apps/pages/renew.aspx

[CRITICAL GAP] Renewal submission windows (e.g., 60-90 days before expiration) are not specified in accessible materials.

### Renewal Fees

[CRITICAL GAP] The specific renewal fee amount is not published in readily accessible statute or board materials reviewed. This should be obtained from the board directly or through the renewal portal.

### Grace Period & Late Renewal

[CRITICAL GAP] Grace period mechanics and late fees are not documented in readily accessible statute or board materials. This should be clarified with the board.

**Confidence Level: HIGH for core 60-hour requirement and unique pain management structure (1+6 hrs), MEDIUM for board cert/MOC alternative and pro-rata provisions, LOW for procedural elements**

The core CME structure is clearly articulated with Oregon's unique pain management approach well-documented. The main challenges are:
1. **Board certification/MOC alternative scope** (does it exempt pain management requirement?)
2. **Pain management 6-hour flexibility** (can it be mixed pain/end-of-life or must be all one?)
3. **Pro-rata pain management calculation** (is it also reduced for newly licensed?)
4. **Procedural gaps** (fees, grace periods, audit details)

## Conclusion

Oregon MD license renewal requirements are **straightforward** (TIER 1) with a unique pain management CME structure (1 hr universal + 6 hrs pain/terminally ill choice) and pro-rata provision for newly licensed physicians.

**Core Requirements Summary:**
- 60 hours biennial CME (or 30 hrs if licensed in 2nd year of biennium), all hours must be AMA Category 1 or AOA Category 1A/2A
- Mandatory pain management structure: 1 hour pain management (all licenses) + 6 hours pain management OR terminally ill/dying patient care
- Board certification/MOC alternative: Active ABMS or AOA-BOS certification may satisfy CME requirement (scope unclear)
- Renewal: Biennial (specific cycle dates not specified in accessible materials)
- Pro-rata provision: 30 hours (50% reduction) for physicians licensed in 2nd year of biennium

**For Physician Compliance:** Complete 60 hours AMA Category 1 (or AOA 1A/2A) CME biennial, ensure 1 hour pain management + 6 hours pain management or end-of-life care is included. Newly licensed physicians in 2nd year of biennium need only 30 hours (verify pain management reduction with board). Physicians with active board certification/MOC should verify exemption scope with board. Maintain CME documentation for potential audit.

**For Rules Engine Implementation:** The main implementation challenges are the unique pain management structure (1+6 hrs with choice), pro-rata provision (requires tracking when physician was licensed within biennium), board cert/MOC alternative scope (exemption details unclear), and biennial cycle coordination (specific dates needed). The 60-hour all-Category-1 requirement with AOA 1A/2A acceptance is straightforward to implement once procedural gaps are resolved.
