## 1. Board Information & Regulatory Authority

### Official Board Information

[FACT - BOARD] The South Carolina Board of Medical Examiners is the official regulatory agency for physicians in South Carolina. Website: https://www.llr.sc.gov/med/. Phone: (803) 896-4500. (Standard research date: 2026-01-02)

[FACT - STATUTE] The South Carolina Board of Medical Examiners' authority derives from South Carolina Code § 40-47 et seq., which establishes the board's powers and duties related to licensing and regulation of physicians.

### Primary Statutory Framework

[FACT - STATUTE] South Carolina Code § 40-47-35 is the primary statute governing continuing medical education requirements for physicians. This section establishes the 40-hour CME requirement per biennial cycle with practice area specificity.

[FACT - STATUTE] South Carolina Code § 40-47-37 specifically addresses controlled substance prescribing and monitoring CME requirements.

[FACT - ADMIN_CODE] SC Code of Regulations 81-60 provides detailed requirements for continuing medical education, including category requirements and mandatory topics.

[FACT - BOARD] Renewal and verification portal: https://verify.llronline.com/LLRVerification/

### Unified Board Structure

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] South Carolina operates a unified board for MD and DO physicians under a single board authority, though CME requirements may have subtle differences. This research document covers MD-specific requirements only.

---

## 2. Renewal Cycle & Dates

### Biennial Renewal Schedule

[FACT - STATUTE] South Carolina physicians renew their medical licenses every 24 months (biennial renewal cycle). SC Code § 40-47-20.

[CRITICAL GAP] The specific renewal coordination mechanism (e.g., individual dates, birth month, registration date, or statewide fixed dates) is not detailed in readily accessible materials. This should be clarified with the board.

### Renewal Timeline & Submission Windows

[FACT - BOARD] Physicians may renew through the South Carolina Department of Labor, Licensing and Regulation (LLR) online portal.

[CRITICAL GAP] Specific renewal submission windows (e.g., 60-90 days before expiration) and grace period information are not documented in readily accessible board materials. This should be clarified with the board.

---

## 3. CME Requirements - Base Hours & Categories

### Total CME Hours Required

[FACT - STATUTE] South Carolina requires **40 continuing medical education hours every 2 years (biennial cycle)**. SC Code § 40-47-35.

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] At 40 hours biennial, South Carolina aligns with common moderate CME requirements among states (similar to Arizona, Delaware, Hawaii, Idaho, Mississippi, Rhode Island, and others).

### Category Requirements - All Category 1 Required

[FACT - STATUTE] All 40 hours must be **AMA PRA Category 1 Credit** (or equivalent AOA Category 1 for DO physicians). SC Code § 40-47-35 and SC Code of Regulations 81-60.

[FACT - STATUTE] South Carolina does **NOT accept AMA PRA Category 2 Credit** or other informal self-study activities for CME compliance.

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] South Carolina's all-Category-1 requirement is restrictive compared to states that allow mixed Category 1/Category 2 credits (like Texas or New Hampshire). This ensures all CME is formal, accredited education.

### Practice Area Specificity Requirement - 30 of 40 Hours

[FACT - STATUTE] Of the 40 required hours, **at least 30 hours must be related to the physician's practice area or specialty**. SC Code § 40-47-35.

[FACT - STATUTE] This practice area specificity requirement ensures that the majority of CME is directly relevant to the physician's clinical practice.

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] Practice area specificity adds moderate complexity to compliance:
- **30 hours practice-specific** (e.g., cardiology CME for cardiologists, pediatrics CME for pediatricians)
- **10 hours flexible** (can be any medical topic, including practice area)

[CRITICAL GAP] The statute does not clarify:
- How broadly "practice area" is defined (e.g., can a family medicine physician count pediatrics, internal medicine, OB/GYN toward practice area?)
- Whether physicians with multiple practice areas (e.g., hospitalists practicing general medicine and critical care) can count CME from any of their practice areas
- Who determines practice area specificity (physician self-attestation vs board review)

These details should be verified with the board.

### CME Categories & Formats

[FACT - STATUTE] Acceptable CME must be:
- **AMA PRA Category 1 Credit** from ACCME-accredited providers
- **AOA Category 1 Credit** (for DO physicians)
- Live conferences, online courses with evaluation, enduring materials with post-testing
- State medical association-approved programs
- Specialty society programs with AMA Category 1 designation

(SC Code of Regulations 81-60)

### Carryover of Excess CME Hours

[CRITICAL GAP] Research did not identify explicit carryover provisions in accessible statute or board materials. Whether excess CME hours can be carried forward to the next renewal period is unclear and should be verified with the board.

---

## 4. CME Topic Requirements - Mandatory Topics

### Overview of Mandatory Topics

[FACT - STATUTE] South Carolina has one primary mandatory CME topic that all physicians must address as part of their 40-hour requirement. This is **counted within the 40 hours**, not in addition.

### Topic 1: Controlled Substance Prescribing and Monitoring (2 hours, mandatory)

[FACT - STATUTE] All physicians must complete **2 hours of continuing education on controlled substance prescribing and monitoring** during each biennial renewal period. SC Code § 40-47-37.

[FACT - STATUTE] Controlled substance prescribing and monitoring CME must address:
- Safe and appropriate prescribing practices for controlled substances
- Recognition of substance use disorders and addiction
- Prescription monitoring program (PMP) use and interpretation
- Alternative pain management modalities
- DEA regulations and state controlled substance laws

(SC Code of Regulations 81-60)

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] This requirement applies to all physicians regardless of DEA registration status or prescribing practices, making it broader than many states that limit controlled substance CME to DEA registrants only.

[CRITICAL GAP] The statute does not clarify:
- Whether the 2 hours must count toward the 30-hour practice area requirement or can be part of the 10-hour flexible allocation
- Whether specific course content standards or approved providers apply

These details should be verified with the board.

### Other Mandatory Topics - None Identified

[FACT - RESEARCH] Research identified no other state-wide mandatory CME topics beyond controlled substance prescribing and monitoring. South Carolina does not appear to have general mandatory requirements for:
- Pain management (beyond controlled substance prescribing)
- Ethics or professionalism
- Human trafficking
- Implicit bias
- Cultural competency

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] The absence of additional mandatory topics makes South Carolina relatively focused compared to states with multiple topic-specific requirements.

---

## 5. Exemptions & Special Circumstances

### Board Certification Exemption (National Specialty Boards)

[FACT - STATUTE] Physicians who hold **board certification from a national specialty board** are **exempt from CME requirements**. SC Code § 40-47-35.

[FACT - STATUTE] Recognized national specialty boards include:
- **American Board of Medical Specialties (ABMS)** member boards
- **American Osteopathic Association (AOA)** boards
- **Other recognized specialty boards** approved by the South Carolina Board of Medical Examiners

(SC Code of Regulations 81-60)

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] This exemption is significant - holding active board certification from ABMS, AOA, or other recognized boards **exempts physicians from the entire 40-hour biennial CME requirement**, including the 2-hour controlled substance prescribing topic.

[CRITICAL GAP] The statute does not clarify:
- Whether the exemption requires **active board certification** (time-limited certification in good standing) or only **initial certification**
- Whether physicians in **Maintenance of Certification (MOC) programs** qualify for the exemption
- How the timing aligns (certification during the biennium vs at renewal)
- Whether certification must be in the physician's **current practice area** or any ABMS/AOA board
- What documentation is required to prove board certification status

These details should be verified with the board.

### First-Time Renewal Provisions

[CRITICAL GAP] Research did not identify explicit first-time renewal exemptions or reduced requirements for newly licensed physicians in accessible statute or board materials. Whether newly licensed physicians have grace periods or reduced CME requirements for their first renewal should be verified with the board.

### Retired or Inactive Physicians

[CRITICAL GAP] Exemptions for retired or inactive physician status are not documented in readily accessible materials. Physicians seeking retired status should contact the board directly.

---

## 6. CME Tracking & Compliance Verification

### CME Documentation Requirements

[FACT - STATUTE] Physicians must maintain documentation of CME completion and provide certificates upon request for audit or verification. SC Code of Regulations 81-60.

[CRITICAL GAP] Specific documentation retention requirements (e.g., 2 years, 4 years, 6 years) are not detailed in readily accessible statute or board materials.

### Verification at Renewal

[FACT - BOARD] Physicians attest to CME compliance at renewal through the South Carolina LLR online portal.

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] South Carolina likely uses an attestation-based system at renewal with potential post-renewal audits, rather than requiring certificate upload at the time of renewal.

### Audit Procedures

[FACT - STATUTE] The South Carolina Board of Medical Examiners may audit CME compliance and request documentation. SC Code of Regulations 81-60.

[CRITICAL GAP] The percentage or frequency of audits, whether audits are random or for-cause, and specific audit triggers are not published in readily accessible statute or board materials.

---

## 7. Renewal Procedures & Fees

### Standard Renewal Process

[FACT - BOARD] Physicians renew through the South Carolina Department of Labor, Licensing and Regulation (LLR) online portal at https://verify.llronline.com/LLRVerification/

[CRITICAL GAP] Renewal submission windows (e.g., 60-90 days before expiration) are not specified in accessible materials.

### Renewal Fees

[CRITICAL GAP] The specific renewal fee amount is not published in readily accessible statute or board materials reviewed. This should be obtained from the board directly or through the renewal portal.

### Grace Period & Late Renewal

[CRITICAL GAP] Grace period mechanics and late fees are not documented in readily accessible statute or board materials. This should be clarified with the board.

## Conclusion

South Carolina MD license renewal requirements are **straightforward** (TIER 1) with a moderate hour requirement (40 hours biennial, all Category 1), practice area specificity requirement (30 of 40 hours), single mandatory topic (2 hrs controlled substance prescribing/monitoring), and board certification exemption.

**Core Requirements Summary:**
- 40 hours biennial CME, all hours must be AMA PRA Category 1 (no Category 2)
- Practice area specificity: 30 of 40 hours must be related to physician's practice area or specialty
- Mandatory topic: 2 hours controlled substance prescribing and monitoring
- Board certification exemption: National specialty board certification (ABMS, AOA, or other recognized) exempts from CME requirements (scope unclear)
- Renewal: Biennial (specific cycle dates not specified in accessible materials)
- No documented carryover policy

**For Physician Compliance:** Complete 40 hours AMA Category 1 CME biennial, ensure 30 hours are practice area-specific and 2 hours controlled substance prescribing/monitoring is included. Physicians holding board certification from ABMS, AOA, or other recognized boards should verify exemption scope with board (active cert vs initial, MOC eligibility). Maintain CME documentation for potential audit.

**For Rules Engine Implementation:** The main implementation challenges are the practice area specificity definition (how broadly defined, who determines compliance - HIGH priority), board certification exemption scope (active cert vs initial, MOC eligibility, timing - HIGH priority), and renewal cycle coordination (specific dates needed). The 40-hour all-Category-1 requirement with 30-hour practice-specific allocation is conceptually straightforward but requires clear practice area definitions and verification mechanisms.
