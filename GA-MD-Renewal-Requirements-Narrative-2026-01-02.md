# Georgia MD License Renewal Requirements - Narrative Research

**Research Period:** January 2, 2026
**Tier Classification:** TIER-1 (Simple State)
**Document Version:** 3.0 (Comprehensive - Expanded)
**Completion:** 85%

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Georgia requires physicians to complete **40 hours of CME per 2-year renewal cycle** with a 25% Category 1 minimum (10 hours). Georgia is notable for its **practice-specific requirements**: physicians in pain clinics or with 50%+ opioid-dependent patients must complete **20 additional hours biennially** of pain management CME. Georgia enforces a strict **90-day penalty period** after license expiration, after which licenses are automatically revoked. The state maintains a unified board for MD/DO physicians and has partnered with **CE Broker** (voluntary) for CME tracking assistance.

**Key Highlights:**
- **CME Requirement:** 40 hours per 2-year renewal cycle (25% Category 1 minimum)
- **Special Pain Requirements:** Additional 20 hrs biennial for pain clinics OR 50%+ opioid patients (exemption for board-certified pain specialists)
- **Renewal Cycle:** Biennial (expires last day of birth month)
- **Penalty Period:** 90 days after expiration; license automatically revoked on day 91
- **Unified Board:** MD and DO have identical requirements
- **Audits:** Random audits conducted; 5-year certificate retention required
- **CME Tracking:** CE Broker partnership (voluntary participation)

[CRITICAL GAP] **Timeline for reinstatement application processing** - not documented.
**Search Attempts:**
1. Searched reinstatement procedures - found fees but not processing timeline
2. Searched board meeting schedules - board meets regularly but no reinstatement timeline specified
3. Searched administrative code on reinstatement - found discretion but no timeframes

3. Searched board website for telemedicine CME - no specific requirement found
**Impact:** Low - Likely no telemedicine-specific CME required, but confirmation would be helpful
