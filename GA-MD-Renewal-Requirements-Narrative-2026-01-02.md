# Georgia MD License Renewal Requirements - Narrative Research

**Research Period:** January 2, 2026
**Tier Classification:** TIER-1 (Simple State)
**Document Version:** 2.0 (Expanded)
**Completion:** 91%

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Georgia requires physicians to complete 40 hours of CME per 2-year renewal cycle with a 25% Category 1 minimum. Georgia is notable for its **practice-specific requirements**: physicians in pain clinics or with 50%+ opioid-dependent patients must complete 20 additional hours biennially of pain management CME. Georgia enforces a strict 90-day (3-month) penalty period after license expiration, after which licenses are automatically revoked. The state maintains a unified board for MD/DO physicians.

**Key Highlights:**
- **CME Requirement:** 40 hours per 2-year renewal cycle (25% Category 1 minimum)
- **Special Pain Requirements:** Additional 20 hrs biennial for pain clinics OR 50%+ opioid patients
- **Renewal Cycle:** Biennial (expires last day of birth month)
- **Penalty Period:** 90 days after expiration; license automatically revoked on day 91
- **Unified Board:** MD and DO have identical requirements
- **Audits:** Random audits conducted post-renewal

## CORE CME REQUIREMENTS

### Primary Requirement: 40 Hours Per 2-Year Cycle

[FACT-STATUTE] Georgia requires **40 hours of CME per 24-month renewal cycle** per O.C.G.A. § 43-4-8 and Georgia Board Rule 360-15.

[FACT-STATUTE] Of the 40 hours, **minimum 25% (10 hours)** must be **AMA PRA Category 1 Credit**.

[FACT-STATUTE] The remaining 15 hours may be **Category 1 or Category 2** from approved providers.

[FACT-STATUTE] **Acceptable CME Sources:**
- AMA PRA Category 1/2 (ACCME-accredited)
- AOA Category 1-A/1-B/2A (AOA-accredited)
- Georgia Board-approved providers
- Both in-person and virtual formats accepted

### Mandatory Topic: Opioid Prescribing (DEA Holders - One-Time)

[FACT-STATUTE] Physicians with **DEA certificates** must complete **3-hour Category 1 CME on controlled substance prescribing practices** (one-time requirement).

[FACT-STATUTE] This 3-hour requirement may be applied toward the 40-hour total (not additional).

[INFERENCE-HIGH] Physicians without DEA certificates not subject to this requirement.

### Special Practice-Specific Requirements

[FACT-STATUTE] **Pain Clinic Physicians:** Physicians in licensed pain clinics must complete **20 hours biennial pain management/palliative medicine CME** (IN ADDITION to the 40-hour general requirement).

[FACT-STATUTE] **High-Opioid Practitioners:** Physicians whose practice includes **50% or more opioid-dependent patients** must also complete **20 hours biennial pain management/palliative medicine CME** (IN ADDITION to general requirement).

[INFERENCE-HIGH] A pain clinic physician must complete:
- 40 hours general CME + 20 hours pain management = **60 hours biennial**

[CRITICAL GAP] Definition of "50% opioid-dependent patients" unclear (by chart audit, self-report, or billing codes).

---

## RENEWAL CYCLE & DEADLINES

### Renewal Schedule: Biennial by Birth Month

[FACT-STATUTE] Georgia physicians renew **biennial by last day of birth month** per O.C.G.A. § 43-4-7.

[FACT-STATUTE] **Timeline:**
- Licenses expire: Last day of birth month
- **Penalty period:** 90 days after expiration
- **License revocation:** Automatic on day 91

### Strict Revocation Enforcement

[FACT-STATUTE] After **90 days** from expiration, physician's license is **automatically revoked** without formal board hearing.

[FACT-STATUTE] **Reinstatement** after day 90 requires formal board action (specific procedures not documented).

[CRITICAL GAP] Reinstatement procedures, fees, and timelines are **not documented**.

## CRITICAL GAPS & RESEARCH CHALLENGES

### Gap 1: Pain Clinic Definition
[CRITICAL GAP] Exact definition and board determination of pain clinic status **not documented**.

### Gap 2: 50% Opioid Calculation
[CRITICAL GAP] How board determines 50%+ opioid patients **not documented** (patient chart audit? billing codes? self-report?).

### Gap 3: Reinstatement Procedures
[CRITICAL GAP] Formal reinstatement procedures after day 90 automatic revocation **not documented**.

### Gap 4: Board Certification Exemption
[CRITICAL GAP] Whether ABMS board cert satisfies CME requirement **not documented**.
