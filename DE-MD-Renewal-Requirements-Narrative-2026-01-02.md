## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Delaware requires physicians to complete 40 hours of CME per biennial period (April 1 - March 31 of odd years). The state is notable for **flexible new licensee requirements**: physicians licensed less than 1 year exempt from CME; those licensed 1-2 years require only 20 hours. Delaware has a clear **1-year reinstatement window** after license expiration and requires **2 hours biennial controlled substance prescribing CME**. The state maintains a unified MD/DO board.

**Key Highlights:**
- **CME Requirement:** 40 hours per biennial period (April 1 - March 31 of odd years)
- **Renewal Cycle:** Biennial (expires March 31, odd-numbered years: 2027, 2029, etc.)
- **New Licensee Tiers:** <1 yr exempt; 1-2 yrs need 20 hrs; 2+ yrs need 40 hrs
- **Controlled Substance:** 2 hours biennial
- **Reinstatement:** Available for 1 year after expiration
- **Unified Board:** MD and DO identical requirements

## CORE CME REQUIREMENTS

### Primary Requirement: 40 Hours Per Biennial Period (April 1 - March 31)

[FACT-STATUTE] Delaware requires **40 hours of CME** per **biennial period (April 1 - March 31 of odd-numbered years)** per Delaware Code Title 24 § 1706.

[FACT-STATUTE] All CME must be **AMA PRA Category 1 or AOA Category 1-A/1-B equivalent**.

[FACT-STATUTE] **In-person and virtual/online** CME accepted from accredited providers.

### Controlled Substance Requirement: 2 Hours Biennial

[FACT-STATUTE] **All physicians must complete 2 hours biennial** in:
- Controlled substance prescribing practices

- Related topics

[FACT-STATUTE] This 2-hour requirement is **included within** the 40-hour total (not additional).

### New Licensee Tiered Requirements

[FACT-STATUTE] **Physicians licensed less than 1 year:** **NO CME required**

[FACT-STATUTE] **Physicians licensed 1-2 years:** **20 hours required** in their first 2-year renewal cycle

[FACT-STATUTE] **Physicians licensed 2+ years:** **40 hours required** (full requirement)

[INFERENCE-HIGH] This tiered structure rewards early licensure and recognizes that newly licensed physicians may have recent training equivalent to CME.

## KEY DISTINCTIONS & FEATURES

**Delaware-Specific Characteristics:**

1. **Mid-Year Cycle (April-March):** Unique timing compared to January-December or calendar-year-based states.

2. **Tiered New Licensee Requirements:** Graduated approach recognizing that recently trained physicians have current knowledge.

3. **Generous Reinstatement Window:** 1-year renewal-without-reinstatement window is favorable compared to states with shorter grace periods.

4. **Moderate CME Burden:** 40 hours biennial is below some states (50-60 hours) and above others (30-35 hours).
