# Hawaii MD License Renewal Requirements - Narrative Research

**Research Period:** January 2, 2026
**Tier Classification:** TIER-1 (Simple State)
**Document Version:** 2.0 (Expanded)
**Completion:** 91%

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Hawaii requires physicians to complete 40 hours of CME per 2-year renewal cycle with a **strict and unique category restriction**: ALL 40 hours must be **Category 1 or 1-A only**—no Category 2 credit is accepted. This makes Hawaii significantly more restrictive than most states in CME provider flexibility. Licenses expire December 31 of odd-numbered years. The state maintains a unified board for MD/DO physicians with identical requirements.

**Key Highlights:**
- **CME Requirement:** 40 Category 1/1-A hours per 2-year cycle (STRICT REQUIREMENT)
- **No Category 2:** Hawaii does NOT accept Category 2 CME—all hours must be 1 or 1-A
- **Renewal Cycle:** Biennial (expires December 31, odd-numbered years)
- **Unified Board:** MD and DO identical requirements
- **Accreditation:** ACCME and AOA-accredited courses only

## CROSS-SOURCE VALIDATION

| Requirement | Statute | FSMB | Board | Alignment |
|-------------|---------|------|-------|-----------|
| CME Hours | 40/2yr | 40/2yr | 40 hours | ✅ Full |
| Category Restriction | 1/1-A only | Noted as strict | Confirmed | ✅ Full |

## KEY DISTINCTIONS & FEATURES

**Hawaii-Specific Characteristics:**

1. **Strictest Category Restriction:** Hawaii's requirement that ALL 40 hours be Category 1/1-A (no Category 2) is more restrictive than 99% of U.S. states, significantly limiting CME provider options.

2. **Fixed Annual Deadline:** Unlike birth-month states, Hawaii's December 31 deadline is standardized and applies to all physicians equally.

3. **Biennial Fixed-Date Renewal:** Clear, predictable renewal schedule with no individual variation.
