## 1. Board Information & Regulatory Authority

### Official Board Information

[FACT - BOARD] The Utah Division of Occupational and Professional Licensing (DOPL), Physicians Licensing Board is the official regulatory agency for physicians in Utah. Website: https://dopl.utah.gov/. Phone: (801) 530-6628. (Accessed 2026-01-02)

[FACT - STATUTE] The Utah DOPL Physicians Licensing Board's authority derives from the Utah Medical Practice Act (Utah Code § 58-67-101 et seq.) and the Utah Occupational and Professional Licensing Act.

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] Utah operates a unified medical board regulating both MD and DO physicians under the same statutory framework and CME requirements.

### Primary Statutory Framework

[FACT - STATUTE] Utah Code § 58-67-303 establishes the statutory requirement for license renewal and continuing competency through continuing medical education. Source: Utah Code § 58-67-303.

[FACT - ADMIN_CODE] Utah Administrative Code R156-67-602 provides the detailed regulatory framework for continuing competency requirements, including the 40-hour biennial requirement, category breakdown, volunteer healthcare credit, and mandatory topics. Source: R156-67-602.

[FACT - BOARD] Renewal portal: https://secure.utah.gov/llv/ (Utah License Lookup and Verification)

---

## 2. Renewal Cycle & Dates

### Biennial Renewal Schedule (Every 2 Years)

[FACT - STATUTE] Utah physicians renew their medical licenses every 2 years (biennial cycle). R156-67-602.

[CRITICAL GAP] The specific renewal deadline dates (birth month, fixed date, license issuance anniversary, etc.) are not documented in the accessible materials reviewed. Physicians should verify their individual renewal date through the DOPL portal or by contacting the board directly.

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] Based on common state practices, Utah likely uses either a birth month renewal system or a license issuance anniversary system. Individual physicians should confirm their renewal date.

### Renewal Timeline & Submission Windows

[CRITICAL GAP] Renewal submission window timeline (e.g., 60 days prior to expiration, 90 days prior) is not documented in accessible materials. Contact DOPL at (801) 530-6628 for specific renewal window information.

[CRITICAL GAP] Grace period mechanics and late renewal procedures are not documented in accessible statute or administrative code materials reviewed.

---

## 3. CME Requirements - Base Hours & Categories

### Total CME Hours Required

[FACT - STATUTE] Utah requires **40 continuing medical education hours every 2 years (biennial renewal cycle)**. Of these 40 hours:
- **Minimum 34 hours must be AMA Category 1 or AOA equivalent**
- **Maximum 6 hours may be from Division of Occupational and Professional Licensing approved sources**

R156-67-602.

[FACT - FSMB] FSMB State CME Requirements document confirms: "40 hrs/2yr, 34 Category 1, 6 max from Division of Occupational & Professional Licensing." This matches the statutory requirement.

### Category Requirements Breakdown

[FACT - STATUTE] The 40-hour requirement is structured as follows:
- **34 hours minimum:** AMA Category 1 or AOA Category 1-A equivalent (formal, accredited CME)
- **6 hours maximum:** Division of Occupational and Professional Licensing (DOPL) approved sources

R156-67-602.

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] The "DOPL-approved sources" provision likely allows for state-specific CME activities, such as Utah-focused public health courses, state medical society programs, or other DOPL-recognized educational activities that may not have national AMA/AOA accreditation.

[CRITICAL GAP] What specific activities or providers qualify as "DOPL-approved sources" is not detailed in accessible materials. Physicians should contact DOPL for a list of approved sources or check the DOPL website for approved CME providers.

### Volunteer Healthcare Credit (Unique to Utah - 15% Credit)

[FACT - STATUTE] Utah offers a unique **15% credit for documented volunteer healthcare service**. Physicians may earn **1 CME hour for every 4 hours of documented volunteer healthcare service**. R156-67-602.

[FACT - FSMB] FSMB confirms: "15% volunteer health care (1 CME per 4 hrs documented)."

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] The volunteer healthcare credit provision allows physicians to reduce their formal CME requirement by providing pro bono healthcare services to underserved populations.

**Calculation Example:**
- Physician provides 16 hours of documented volunteer healthcare service
- Credit: 16 hours ÷ 4 = 4 CME hours
- 15% of 40-hour requirement = 6 hours maximum credit
- Result: Physician earns 4 CME hours, reducing formal CME requirement from 40 to 36 hours

[CRITICAL GAP] Specific documentation requirements for volunteer healthcare service (e.g., clinic attestation, logs, patient encounter documentation) are not detailed in accessible materials.

[CRITICAL GAP] What qualifies as "volunteer healthcare service" (e.g., free clinics, mission work, community health fairs, telehealth for underserved) is not defined in accessible materials.

[CRITICAL GAP] The maximum volunteer credit allowed (is it capped at 15% of 40 hours = 6 hours, or unlimited?) is not explicitly stated in accessible materials.

## 4. CME Topic Requirements - Mandatory Topics

### Overview of Mandatory Topics

[FACT - STATUTE] Utah has two mandatory CME topics:
1. **3.5 hours controlled substance courses** (biennial, for prescribers only)
2. **1 suicide prevention online course** (all physicians, from state-provided list)

R156-67-602 and Utah Controlled Substance Database Act.

[FACT - FSMB] FSMB confirms: "Controlled substance prescribers: 3.5 hrs controlled substance courses. Suicide prevention: 1 online course from state-provided list."

### Topic 1: Controlled Substance Courses (3.5 hours biennial, CONDITIONAL - Prescribers Only)

[FACT - STATUTE] Physicians who **prescribe controlled substances** must complete **3.5 hours of controlled substance courses** every 2 years (biennial). This requirement applies only to physicians with prescribing authority. R156-67-602.

[FACT - FSMB] FSMB confirms: "Controlled substance prescribers: 3.5 hrs controlled substance courses."

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] The 3.5-hour controlled substance requirement is conditional based on prescribing activity. Physicians who do not prescribe controlled substances (e.g., pathologists, radiologists, some psychiatrists) are not subject to this requirement.

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] The 3.5-hour requirement is integrated into the 40-hour biennial total (not in addition to the 40 hours). Prescribing physicians complete 3.5 hours of controlled substance CME plus 36.5 hours of other CME to reach the 40-hour total.

**Controlled Substance CME Content Areas (Likely):**
- Safe prescribing practices for opioids, benzodiazepines, and other controlled substances
- Controlled substance risk assessment and screening
- Utah Controlled Substance Database (UCSD) use and interpretation
- Recognition of substance use disorder and addiction
- Alternative pain management strategies
- CDC and state opioid prescribing guidelines
- Prescription monitoring program best practices

[CRITICAL GAP] Specific acceptable courses, providers, or content standards for the 3.5-hour controlled substance requirement are not detailed in accessible materials. Physicians should verify acceptable courses with DOPL or review ACCME-accredited controlled substance CME offerings.

### Topic 2: Suicide Prevention (1 online course, MANDATORY - All Physicians)

[FACT - STATUTE] All physicians must complete **1 suicide prevention online course from a state-provided list**. This requirement applies to all physicians regardless of specialty or practice setting. Utah Controlled Substance Database Act and R156-67-602.

[FACT - FSMB] FSMB confirms: "Suicide prevention: 1 online course from state-provided list."

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] Utah provides a list of approved suicide prevention courses, likely available on the DOPL website or through the Utah Department of Health. Physicians must select a course from this approved list.

[CRITICAL GAP] The specific list of approved suicide prevention courses is not documented in accessible materials reviewed. Physicians should check the DOPL website or contact DOPL for the current list of approved courses.

[CRITICAL GAP] Whether the suicide prevention requirement is one-time, biennial, or on another cycle is not explicitly stated in accessible materials. The FSMB reference to "1 online course" suggests it may be a one-time or infrequent requirement, but confirmation is needed.

**Suicide Prevention CME Content Areas (Likely):**
- Suicide risk assessment and screening tools
- Warning signs and risk factors for suicidal ideation
- Evidence-based interventions for suicide prevention
- Crisis intervention strategies
- Referral resources and crisis hotlines
- Means restriction counseling
- Follow-up care for patients at risk

---

## 5. Exemptions & Alternatives

### Controlled Substance CME Exemption (Non-Prescribers)

[FACT - STATUTE] The 3.5-hour controlled substance CME requirement applies only to **physicians who prescribe controlled substances**. Physicians who do not prescribe controlled substances are exempt from this requirement. R156-67-602.

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] Non-prescribing physicians (e.g., pathologists, radiologists, some research physicians) complete only 40 hours of general CME plus the 1 suicide prevention course, without the 3.5-hour controlled substance requirement.

### Board Certification (ABMS/AOA)

[CRITICAL GAP] Whether ABMS board certification or ABMS Maintenance of Certification (MOC) provides any exemption or credit toward the Utah CME requirement is not documented in accessible materials.

[INFERENCE - LOW CONFIDENCE] Unlike some states (e.g., Texas, Idaho) that provide explicit CME exemptions for board-certified physicians, Utah does not appear to offer a board certification exemption in the accessible statute and administrative code. However, board certification activities (MOC) may count toward the 40-hour Category 1 requirement if they are ACCME-accredited.

### Newly Licensed Physicians

[CRITICAL GAP] Whether newly licensed physicians (first-time renewals) receive any exemption, reduction, or pro-rated CME requirement is not documented in accessible materials.

### Military Service & Hardship Exemptions

[CRITICAL GAP] Military service exemptions, hardship exemptions, or other special circumstances (illness, disability, etc.) are not documented in accessible materials.

---

## 6. Audit & Verification Procedures

### CME Documentation Requirements

[FACT - STATUTE] Physicians must maintain documentation of CME completion for audit and verification purposes. R156-67-602.

[CRITICAL GAP] The specific documentation retention period (e.g., 4 years, 6 years, duration of licensure) is not documented in accessible materials.

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] Physicians should retain CME certificates, transcripts, or other proof of completion for at least the duration of the current renewal cycle plus one additional cycle (approximately 4 years) to ensure availability in case of audit.

### Volunteer Healthcare Service Documentation

[FACT - STATUTE] Physicians claiming volunteer healthcare credit must maintain documentation of volunteer service (4 hours documented = 1 CME hour). R156-67-602.

[CRITICAL GAP] The specific documentation requirements for volunteer service (e.g., clinic attestation letter, volunteer logs, supervisor signature) are not detailed in accessible materials.

### Audit Procedures

[FACT - STATUTE] The Utah DOPL conducts random audits of physicians for CME compliance. R156-67-602.

[CRITICAL GAP] The percentage or frequency of audits (e.g., 5% of renewals annually, 10% of renewals) is not published in statute or accessible materials.

[CRITICAL GAP] Audit response timeline (e.g., 30 days to provide documentation, 60 days) is not documented.

[CRITICAL GAP] Consequences of audit non-compliance (fines, license suspension, additional CME requirements) are not detailed in accessible materials.

---

## 7. Renewal Procedures & Fees

### Standard Renewal Process

[FACT - BOARD] Physicians renew through the Utah online portal at: https://secure.utah.gov/llv/ (Utah License Lookup and Verification)

[CRITICAL GAP] Renewal submission window (when renewal opens prior to expiration) is not documented in accessible materials.

### Renewal Fees

[CRITICAL GAP] The specific renewal fee amount is not published in accessible materials reviewed. Physicians should check the renewal portal or contact DOPL at (801) 530-6628 for current fee information.

### Grace Period & Late Renewal

[CRITICAL GAP] Grace period mechanics (if any), late renewal procedures, and late fees are not documented in statute or accessible materials.

---

## 8. Lapsed License Reinstatement

### Reinstatement Procedures

[CRITICAL GAP] Lapsed license reinstatement procedures, timelines, and CME requirements for reinstatement are not documented in the materials reviewed.

[INFERENCE - LOW CONFIDENCE] Utah likely has tiered reinstatement procedures based on length of lapse (e.g., <1 year, 1-3 years, >3 years), similar to other TIER 1 states, but specific requirements are not documented.

---

## 9. Controlled Substance Context

### Controlled Substance CME (3.5 hours biennial, prescribers only)

[FACT - STATUTE] As detailed in Section 4, physicians who prescribe controlled substances must complete 3.5 hours of controlled substance courses biennial. R156-67-602.

### Utah Controlled Substance Database (UCSD)

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] The 3.5-hour controlled substance requirement likely includes training on the Utah Controlled Substance Database (UCSD), which is Utah's prescription drug monitoring program (PDMP).

[CRITICAL GAP] Whether the 3.5-hour requirement includes a specific component on UCSD/PDMP use (similar to Nebraska's 0.5-hour PDMP requirement) is not documented.

---

## 10. CME Tracking Systems

### CME Tracking & Documentation

[CRITICAL GAP] Whether Utah uses a centralized CME tracking system (e.g., CE Broker) or relies on physician attestation and audit is not documented in accessible materials.

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] Based on common TIER 1 state practices, Utah likely uses a physician attestation system where physicians certify CME completion during renewal, with documentation verified only upon audit.

### CME Provider Auto-Reporting

[CRITICAL GAP] Whether CME providers are required to auto-report completion to the Utah board is not documented.

## Conclusion

Utah MD license renewal requirements are **straightforward and simple** (TIER 1) with a standard biennial CME requirement, minimal mandatory topics, and a unique volunteer healthcare credit provision.

**Core Requirements Summary:**
- 40 hours biennial CME: 34 hours minimum AMA Category 1 or AOA equivalent, maximum 6 hours from DOPL-approved sources
- 3.5 hours controlled substance courses biennial (prescribers only)
- 1 suicide prevention online course (all physicians, from state-provided list)
- Volunteer healthcare credit: 1 CME hour per 4 hours documented volunteer service (15% credit provision)
- Biennial renewal cycle (specific dates not documented)
- Random audits conducted

**Key Simplicity Factors:**
1. Single biennial CME requirement (40 hours)
2. Clear category breakdown (34 Category 1, max 6 DOPL-approved)
3. Minimal mandatory topics (3.5 hours controlled substance for prescribers, 1 suicide prevention)
4. Unique volunteer healthcare credit provides flexibility and supports community service
5. Conditional controlled substance requirement (prescribers only)

**For Physician Compliance:** Complete 40 hours of CME every 2 years (34 hours minimum Category 1, maximum 6 hours DOPL-approved). Prescribing physicians must complete 3.5 hours on controlled substances. All physicians must complete 1 suicide prevention online course from state-provided list. Physicians providing volunteer healthcare service may earn credit (1 CME hour per 4 hours documented service).

**For Rules Engine Implementation:** The primary implementation challenges are clarifying DOPL-approved sources, volunteer healthcare credit documentation and maximum, suicide prevention course list and cycle, and renewal date mechanics. The controlled substance requirement is conditional based on prescribing status. Fee information and procedural details need to be obtained from the board for complete implementation.
