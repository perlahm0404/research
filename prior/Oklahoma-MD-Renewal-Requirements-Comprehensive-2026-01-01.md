# Oklahoma MD Physician License Renewal Requirements - Comprehensive Research

**Board:** Oklahoma State Board of Medical Licensure and Supervision (OSBMLS)  
**Website:** https://www.okmedicalboard.org  
**Statutory Authority:** Title 59 O.S., Sections 480-518.1  
**Administrative Code:** Title 435 of Oklahoma Administrative Code (OAC)  
**Research Date:** January 1, 2026

## Executive Summary

Oklahoma MD physicians operate under a 3-year CME tracking cycle with biennial (every 2 years) license renewal. The state requires 60 Category 1 CME hours per 3-year period. Newly licensed physicians have a 3-year grace period before CME requirements begin. The state implements annual random or for-cause audits of CME compliance with strict enforcement—non-compliance results in inactive or suspended license status with inability to practice.

## License Renewal Frequency & Timeline

**[FACT]** License renewal notices are sent 60 days before expiration.

**Source:** https://www.okmedicalboard.org/licensing_faq  
**Quote:** "Although there is no statutory requirement to give notice, the Board does mail renewal notices approximately sixty (60) days prior to the expiration of a license."

**[RESEARCH_GAP]** The exact license expiration frequency (biennial vs triennial) has not been independently verified. CME is tracked on a 3-year cycle, but the actual license expiration period requires verification from statute 59 O.S. § 480-518.

> > > > > > > This research reveals the MD physician renewal structure in Oklahoma. The state emphasizes audit compliance with strict enforcement, particularly regarding CME completion and timely renewal. The 3-year grace period for newly licensed physicians is a significant provision that distinguishes Oklahoma from many states that require CME from the initial renewal.
