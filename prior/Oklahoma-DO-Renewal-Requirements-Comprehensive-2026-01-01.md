# Oklahoma DO Physician License Renewal Requirements - Comprehensive Research

**Board:** Oklahoma State Board of Osteopathic Examiners (OSBOE)  
**Website:** https://oklahoma.gov/osboe/  
**Statutory Authority:** Title 62 O.S., Sections 620-642  
**Administrative Code:** Title 510 of Oklahoma Administrative Code (OAC)  
**Research Date:** January 1, 2026  
**Researcher:** Independent Research via Primary Sources

## Executive Summary

Oklahoma DO physicians have significantly different requirements from MD physicians, most notably operating on an **annual** renewal cycle with 16 AOA Category 1 CME hours required per year. This represents a substantial departure from the MD triennial system. DOs can substitute AMA Category 1 hours if they hold ABMS board certification. The state requires a biennial 3-hour CME course (specific topic TBD), and renewal must occur before July 1st each year. An annual renewal fee of $250.00 applies.

## License Renewal Requirements

### Renewal Frequency & Deadline

**[FACT]** Oklahoma DO physicians must renew their licenses annually before July 1st.

**Source:** Multiple CME provider sites and https://oklahoma.gov/osboe/faqsoklahoma.gov  
**Quote:** "All licenses must be renewed each year prior to July 1st"

**[CRITICAL DIFFERENCE FROM MD]** Unlike MD physicians who operate on a 3-year CME tracking cycle, DO physicians renew annually with annual CME hour requirements.

      > > ### CME Category Requirements
      > >
      > > **[FACT]** DO physicians have two acceptable CME category paths:
      > >
      > > **Primary Requirement:** AOA Category 1-A or 1-B hours
      > > **Alternative:** AMA Category 1 hours (only if ABMS board certified)

      > > >
      > > > ### Biennial Mandated CME Course
      > > >
      > > > **[FACT]** Every two years, a 3-hour CME course is required.

      > > > >
      > > > > **[RESEARCH_GAP]** The specific topic of this biennial 3-hour requirement has not been identified. It likely relates to proper prescribing or pain management (given the board's emphasis on these areas), but this needs confirmation from full OAC 510 or board guidance.

      > > > > > **[RESEARCH_GAP]** Specific details regarding DO physician audit procedures, audit frequency, and verification methods have not been independently verified for this research. The MD board conducts annual random or for-cause audits; DO procedures likely follow a similar pattern but require confirmation from OSBOE guidance.

      > > > > > > This research reveals the DO physician renewal structure in Oklahoma, which differs substantially from MD requirements. The annual renewal cycle with 16 CME hours per year represents a significantly different compliance pattern than the MD triennial system. DO physicians have more flexibility in CME categories (can use AMA hours if ABMS board certified) compared to MD physicians.

      > > > > > > The critical unresolved gaps regarding late renewal procedures and the specific topic of the biennial 3-hour requirement should be clarified before implementing rules engine logic to ensure proper compliance guidance for DO physicians.
      > > > > > >
      > > > > > > The annual renewal deadline of July 1st (compared to MD's unresolved frequency) is a distinctive feature that must be accurately captured in any rules engine implementation.
