## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Massachusetts requires physicians to renew their Full License every two years (biennial renewal). The renewal process is managed through an online portal () and costs $600. The primary statutory authority is Massachusetts General Law Chapter 112, Section 2, which mandates specific CME requirements for renewal, including a one-time requirement for training on diagnosis, treatment and care of patients with cognitive impairments (including Alzheimer’s disease and dementia).

Key Finding: Massachusetts has NOT been identified as a split-board state (MD vs DO board distinction does not apply in Massachusetts).

## RESEARCH GAPS AND CRITICAL QUESTIONS

### CRITICAL GAPS - RESOLUTION STATUS

| Gap # | Topic | Status | Confidence | Resolution |

|-------|-------|--------|------------|------------|

| 1 | Certificate Upload Requirement | ✅ FOUND | HIGH | Physicians do NOT need to upload CME certificates with renewal |

| 2 | Lapsed License Reinstatement | ⚠️ PARTIAL | MEDIUM | Fee ($700) and 2-year competency rule found; tiered breakdown requires Policy 03-03 review |

| 3 | Board Certification/MOC Exemption | ⚠️ PARTIAL | MEDIUM | Policy 94-05 identified but requires document review for ABMS/AOA details |

| 4 | Late Renewal Grace Period | ❌ NOT FOUND | LOW | No grace period specified in statute or accessible materials; requires BORIM contact |

| 5 | Late Renewal Fee | ❌ NOT FOUND | LOW | Not found in accessible fee schedules; requires BORIM contact |

| 6 | CME Record Retention Duration | ❌ NOT FOUND | LOW | FAQ states "keep your own records" but duration not specified; requires BORIM contact |

| 7 | Audit Response Timeline | ❌ NOT FOUND | LOW | No timeline specified; requires BORIM contact |

| 8 | Residency/Fellowship CME Credit | ❌ NOT FOUND | LOW | Not addressed on website; requires BORIM contact |

| 9 | Implicit Bias Approved Providers | ⚠️ PARTIAL | MEDIUM | BORIM has compiled list; requires direct website navigation to Implicit Bias Resource Page |

### RESEARCH GAPS - ORIGINAL ANALYSIS

### HIGH GAPS (Affects User Experience)

Audit procedures (random vs for-cause, percentage, response timeline)

- Rollover policy for excess CME credits

- Exemptions for board certification/MOC

- Residency/fellowship training credit

- AMA PRA Award credit

- Specific CME provider requirements

- Implicit bias CME requirement (existence and hours)

### MEDIUM GAPS (Edge Cases)

Lapsed license procedures by duration

- Background check requirements for reinstatement

- Reexamination requirements

- Medical marijuana/cannabis CME (if applicable)

- Telemedicine-specific requirements

### LOW GAPS (Nice to Have)

Board statistics on audit rates

- Historical changes to CME requirements

- Board meeting schedules

- Disciplinary action statistics

## FSMB COMPARISON

**FSMB State CME Overview - Massachusetts:**

[RESEARCH NEEDED - Access FSMB database for current Massachusetts entry]

**Known Discrepancies:**

FSMB may not have detailed information on cognitive impairments CME requirement (relatively new 2018 requirement)

- Malpractice insurance minimum ($100,000/$300,000) should be verified against FSMB

- Biennial renewal confirmed

—

## KEY FINDINGS - MASSACHUSETTS-SPECIFIC

**Biennial Renewal:** Physicians renew every 2 years on their birthday - CONFIRMED from statute

**Online Renewal:** Massachusetts requires online renewal through  - CONFIRMED

**$600 Renewal Fee:** Standard biennial renewal fee - CONFIRMED

**Cognitive Impairments CME:** One-time requirement for physicians serving adult populations - CONFIRMED from statute M.G.L. c. 112, § 2

**Malpractice Insurance Required:** Active licensees must carry $100,000/$300,000 minimum - CONFIRMED from statute

**Status Options:** Active, Inactive, Retired - CONFIRMED from board website

**No Split-Board Structure:** Massachusetts does not have separate MD and DO boards - CONFIRMED

**License Revocation:** Automatic upon non-renewal; can be revived upon completion - CONFIRMED from statute and board website

## NEXT RESEARCH STEPS

### IMMEDIATE ACTIONS (Critical for Rules Engine)

[ ] Download and extract “BORIM CME Requirements” document

   - Extract total CME hours per 2-year cycle

   - Extract specific topic requirements and hours

   - Extract verification documentation requirements

2. [ ] Contact BORIM at (781) 876-8200 or  to clarify:

   - Total CME hours required

   - Late renewal grace period and fee

   - Audit procedures

   - Documentation retention requirements

3. [ ] Review “Final Amended Guidelines for Fulfilling the CME and Educational Trainings Requirements”

   - Extract specific requirements

   - Clarify whether cognitive impairments is one-time or recurring

   - Identify exemptions and alternatives

4. [ ] Review “Policy 94-05” on Board Certification CME Credit

Determine whether ABMS MOC satisfies requirements

   - Determine whether AOA MOC satisfies requirements

5. [ ] Review “Policy 03-03” on Lapsed License Applications

   - Extract lapsed license reinstatement procedures

   - Identify CME makeup requirements

### SECONDARY ACTIONS (Improves Rules Engine)

6. [ ] Review Policy 17-05: CME Pilot Program

7. [ ] Review Policy 21-04: Implicit Bias CME

8. [ ] Review Policy 15-05: Prescribing Practices Policy

9. [ ] Research Massachusetts medical marijuana CME (if required)

10. [ ] Verify malpractice insurance verification method at renewal

## NOTES

Massachusetts statute only mandates ONE specific CME topic: cognitive impairments (Alzheimer’s disease/dementia) for physicians serving adult populations

- No other CME hours or topics are specified in the statute; all additional requirements come from board policies/guidelines

- The requirement to review regulations as a condition of licensure may imply CME on regulatory changes

- Implicit bias training may be required based on Policy 21-04 on board website

- Prescribing practices policy is extensive (199.43 KB) and likely relevant to CME requirements for certain specialties
