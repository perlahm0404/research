**What is the difference between active, inactive and retired status?**

Active Status:  An active licensee may practice medicine and may prescribe medications.  An active licensee must complete the Board’s Continuing Medical Education (CME) requirements.  In addition, an active licensee engaged in direct or indirect patient care, must maintain mandatory medical malpractice insurance coverage in the minimum amount of $100,000/$300,000.

Inactive License:  An inactive licensee may not practice medicine or prescribe or provide direct or indirect patient care.  A licensee who is inactive is exempt from the continuing medical education requirements and malpractice liability insurance.  A physician may change from inactive to active status by completing the Active Status Request Form that is available on the Board’s website.

Retired Status:  A retired licensee may not practice medicine or prescribe or provide direct or indirect patient care.  When you no longer wish to practice medicine in Massachusetts, you may apply for a retired status.  When considering retirement, the licensee may contact the Massachusetts Medical Society’s legal department to request their pamphlet titled “Issues for the Retiring Physician.”  A retirement form is available on the Board’s website.
