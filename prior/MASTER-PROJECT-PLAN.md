```
AL, AK, AR, CO, CT, DE, GA, HI, ID, KS, LA, MA, MS,
NE, NH, NJ, NM, ND, OH, OR, RI, UT, WI
```

**Research Focus:**
- Single medical board (no split)

MO (check unification), MN (check unification), NV (MD+DO),
PA (MD+DO), TN (MD+DO), VT (MD+DO), WA (MD+DO), WV (MD+DO)
```

**Research Focus:**
- Separate boards with DIFFERENT requirements
- Document both boards independently
- Create comparison table highlighting differences
- Explain WHY boards differ (regulatory context)

**Priority Order (by difficulty):**
1. **Priority 1 (Similar requirements):** AZ, TN, VT
2. **Priority 2 (Different categories):** CA, PA, FL, MN
3. **Priority 3 (Different hours):** MI
4. **Priority 4 (Major differences):** ME (40 vs 100), NV (40/2yr vs 40/yr), WA (200/4yr vs 150/3yr), WV (50 vs 32)

---

### TIER 3: COMPLEX STATES (30+ states)
**30+ documents × 10-15 hours = 300-450 hours**
**Target: 70%+ completion, focus on specialized requirements**

**High Complexity:**
```
IL, NC, NJ, NY, PR, TX, WA, WV (if not Tier-2)
```

**Moderate Complexity:**
```
DC, GU, MP, SC, VI (territories), other states with specialty requirements
```

**Research Focus:**
- Multiple mandatory topics (5+)
- Specialty-specific requirements
- Regulatory timeline (effective dates)
- Conditional exemptions
- State-specific context (marijuana, jurisprudence, etc.)

---

### TIER 4: NO CME STATES (4 states)
**4 documents × 2-3 hours = 8-12 hours**
**Target: 50%+ completion, research WHY and what alternatives exist**

```
IN, MT, NY (no set hours), SD
```

**Research Focus:**
- Why no set CME hours?
- What verification does board conduct?
- Are there topic-specific mandates?
- Board certification alternatives?

---

### NP RESEARCH (Separate Track - Optional for YOLO Phase 1)
**50 state NP profiles × 2 hours = 100 hours**
**Target: 40-50% completion, rapid scan for future deep research**

- Identify NP board (usually Board of Nursing, separate from Medical Board)
- Document NP vs. RN CME split
- Note prescriptive authority variations
- Flag states with unique NP requirements

---

## YOLO MODE EXECUTION STRATEGY

### Phase 1: Tier 1 Blitz (Sprint 1 - Week 1)
**Goal:** Complete 22 simple states with 70%+ completion

**Approach:**
1. Select 3-4 agents (or run sequentially)
2. Assign Batch A, B, C to different agents if parallel
3. Each agent follows TIER-1-Research-Prompt exactly
4. Update tracker CSV after EACH state completion
5. Target: 4-5 states per day per agent

**Success Metric:** 22 TIER-1 documents, all at 70%+ completion, all tracked

**Deliverable:** 22 publishable research documents covering ~33% of US population

---

### Phase 2: Tier 2 Deep Research (Sprint 2 - Week 2-3)
**Goal:** Complete 13 split-board states (26 documents) with 70%+ completion

**Approach:**
1. Research in priority order (Priority 1 first)
2. Each state = 2 documents (MD + DO)
3. Each agent handles 1-2 states per week
4. Create comparison table for EACH state
5. Update tracker CSV with both MD and DO completion %

**Success Metric:** 26 TIER-2 documents, both MD and DO at 70%+

**Challenge Areas:**
- Maine: 2.5x CME difference (40 vs 100)
- Nevada: Annual vs Biennial frequency
- Washington: Different cycles (200/4yr vs 150/3yr)
- West Virginia: Reverse pattern (MD > DO, unusual)

---

### Phase 3: Tier 3 Investigation (Sprint 3-4 - Week 4-6)
**Goal:** Complete 30+ complex states with 70%+ completion

**Approach:**
1. Start with "High Complexity" states (IL, NC, NJ, NY, PR, TX)
2. Deep research into statutory requirements
3. Document ALL mandatory topics individually
4. Track effective dates and regulatory timeline
5. Identify specialty-specific requirements
6. Research pending regulatory changes

**Success Metric:** 30+ TIER-3 documents at 70%+

**Research Challenges:**
- Illinois: 6-year sub-cycles within 3-year renewal
- Texas: Flexible CME options (formal + informal)
- New York: NO set hours (research why)
- Puerto Rico: 11+ specific CME mandates

---

### Phase 4: No-CME States & NP Rapid Scan (Sprint 5)
**Goal:** Document 4 no-CME states and rapid scan NP requirements

**Approach:**
1. Research why IN, MT, NY, SD have no set CME
2. Document board verification methods
3. Rapid scan 50 states for NP requirements
4. Flag states with unique NP regulations
5. Create NP research backlog for Phase 2

**Success Metric:** 4 clarified no-CME states, 50 NP profiles at 40%+

---

## TRACKER CSV WORKFLOW

### Before Research Begins:
1. Agent opens `/Users/tmac/research/state-research-tracker.csv`
2. Finds their assigned state row
3. **Sets status to "IN_PROGRESS"**
4. Notes researcher name in `researcher_assigned` column
5. **Begins research using appropriate tier prompt**

### During Research:
1. Agent updates `md_completion_%` (or `do_completion_%`) as work progresses
2. Real-time updates every 1-2 hours
3. CSV reflects current project state

### After Research Complete:
1. Agent sets status to "COMPLETE"
2. **Fills in document filename** (e.g., "Alabama-MD-Renewal-Requirements-Narrative-2026-01-02.md")
3. **Updates completion percentage** (target 70%+)
4. **Notes critical gaps or unique findings** in `notes` column
5. Updates `last_updated` date
6. **Commits CSV to git**

### CSV Column Guide:

```
state_abbr: Two-letter abbreviation (AL, AK, etc.)
state_name: Full state name
tier: TIER-1, TIER-2, TIER-3, TIER-4, NP-TRACK
md_status: PENDING, IN_PROGRESS, COMPLETE
md_completion_%: 0-100% (aim for 70%+)
md_document: Filename of MD research document
do_status: PENDING, IN_PROGRESS, COMPLETE (Tier 2 only)
do_completion_%: 0-100% (aim for 70%+)
do_document: Filename of DO research document
np_status: PENDING, IN_PROGRESS, COMPLETE (NP track)
np_completion_%: 0-100% (aim for 40%+ for phase 1)
np_document: Filename of NP research document
last_updated: Date format YYYY-MM-DD
researcher_assigned: Name of agent/person
notes: Critical gaps, unique findings, next steps
critical_gaps: List of unfilled research gaps
board_website: Official board URL
board_contact: Board contact info (phone/email)
```

## QUALITY GATES & COMPLETION STANDARDS

### Minimum Quality for Publication (50%)
- Core CME hours documented
- Renewal cycle identified
- Controlled substance requirements if applicable
- Board contact information
- Known gaps documented

### Standard Quality for Publication (70%)
- All major sections complete
- Evidence classification on 85%+ of claims
- Cross-source congruency verified for main requirements
- Critical gaps documented with search attempts
- Ready for board validation

### Gold Standard (85%+)
- All 14-15 sections complete
- Evidence classification on 95%+ of claims

---

## RISK MITIGATION

### Risk 1: Board Contact Unavailable
**Mitigation:** Document all search attempts. Mark gap as HIGH priority. Move on to next state. Schedule callback.

### Risk 2: Statute Conflicts with FSMB
**Mitigation:** Trust statute as primary source. Document conflict with explanation. Note in tracker for validation.

### Risk 3: Pending Regulatory Changes
**Mitigation:** Document effective date. Note in tracker. Flag for future monitoring.

### Risk 4: Specialty-Specific Requirements Undiscovered
**Mitigation:** Search statute for practice-area-specific language. Systematic search for specialties. Contact board if unclear.

### Risk 5: DO Board Information Scarce
**Mitigation:** Expected for Tier 2. Deep board website search. Contact OSBOE or state osteopathic association. Use FSMB as starting point.
