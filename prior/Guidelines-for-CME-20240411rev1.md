As of Jan. 1, 2018, the Board is conducting a CME Pilot Program.  A licensee must complete 50 hours of CME within each licensing cycle. The CMEs may be in Category 1 or 2. Most of the 50 credits should be in your area of practice. Licensees must also complete certain specialized CME Requirements and Educational Trainings. The Board would like to clarify a few questions that have arisen.

**What if ****I fulfill one of the one-time requirements**** outside of the license renewal cycle?  For example, ****can I satisfy the requirement ****if I t****ook**** the Child Abuse and Neglect Training in ****medical school 5 years ago?** 

Yes, for the one-time requirements, you can satisfy the requirement no matter when you took the  course or training. 

**Does it satisfy the Board’s ****CME and Educational Training****s**** ****requirement****s**** if I take**** the course or training out-of-state?**  

Yes, out-of-state courses can be used to satisfy these requirements if the course is sponsored by an accredited provider and is of the same content and duration. 

**How can I fulfill the Child Abuse or Neglect Training?  **

There is information and a training video at this website.    

Even if you have received training before, please review this website to familiarize yourself with the Massachusetts reporting system for mandated reporters. 

**How can I fulfill the Domestic Violence and Sexual Violence Training requirement? **

The Department of Public Health has developed an e-Learning tool that can be accessed from the DPH’s DVSV Integration Initiatives webpage.     Only a DPH-approved course can fulfill the requirement. 

**Is the Board randomly auditing physicians****’**** CME and Educational Training****s**** requirements? **

Unless linked to an investigation of substandard care or dishonesty, the Board is not currently doing CME audits.
