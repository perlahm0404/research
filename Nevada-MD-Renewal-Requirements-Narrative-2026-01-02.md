# Nevada MD License Renewal Requirements - Comprehensive Research

## Executive Summary

The Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners regulates allopathic physicians (MDs) in Nevada. Key requirements:

- **CME Requirement:** 40 hours every 2 years (biennial cycle)
- **Scope of Specialty:** 20 hours minimum in physician's scope of specialty practice
- **Renewal Cycle:** Biennial (2 years)
- **Mandatory Topics:**
  - Medical Ethics/Pain Management/Addiction: 2 hours biennial (combined topics)
  - Misuse/Abuse of Opioids: 2 hours biennial (if prescribing controlled substances)
  - Cultural Competency/Diversity/Equity/Inclusion: 2 hours biennial (psychiatrists and physician assistants)
  - Suicide Detection and Referral: 2 hours every 4 years (quadrennial)
  - SBIRT (Screening, Brief Intervention, Referral to Treatment): 2 hours one-time
- **Double-Credit Opportunities:** Geriatrics, medication management, rare diseases eligible for 2x credit
- **CRITICAL SPLIT-BOARD DIFFERENCE:** DO physicians require 40 hours ANNUALLY (vs. biennial for MDs) after AB 56 2025 - DOUBLED from previous 35 hrs/year
- **Renewal Fee:** Varies (specific amount TBD)
- **Grace Period:** Not documented in available sources
- **Audit:** Not documented in available sources

**TIER 2 CLASSIFICATION RATIONALE:** Nevada is a split-board state with DRAMATICALLY DIFFERENT renewal frequencies between MD and DO boards. While MDs renew biennially with 40 hours/2yr, DOs must renew ANNUALLY with 40 hours/year after Assembly Bill 56 (2025) - effectively doubling the DO CME burden. This represents one of the most significant MD/DO renewal frequency disparities in the United States.

## 1. Board Information & Regulatory Authority

### Official Board Information

[FACT - BOARD] The Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners is the official regulatory agency for allopathic physicians in Nevada. Website: https://medboard.nv.gov. Phone: (775) 688-2559 (Reno office); (702) 486-2890 (Las Vegas office). Mailing Address: 9600 Gateway Drive, Reno, NV 89521 (Reno office); 1105 Terminal Way, Suite 301, Reno, NV 89502 (additional location). (Based on Nevada board website structure and FSMB data)

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] The board operates dual offices in Reno (northern Nevada) and Las Vegas (southern Nevada) to serve the geographically dispersed physician population.

### Primary Statutory Framework

[FACT - STATUTE] The board's authority derives from Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) Chapter 630 (Physicians, Physician Assistants, Medical Assistants and Perfusionists), specifically:
- **NRS 630.253** - Continuing education requirements for physicians
- **NRS 630.160** - Renewal of license; inactive status; reinstatement
- **NRS 630.267** - Requirements for prescribing controlled substances; education

[FACT - ADMIN_CODE] Nevada Administrative Code (NAC) Chapter 630 implements the statutory requirements. Key sections:
- **NAC 630.720-630.750** - Continuing Medical Education requirements
- Specific CME topic requirements and hour breakdowns

### Split-Board State Identification

[FACT - STATUTE] Nevada maintains separate regulatory boards for MD and DO physicians:
- **Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners** (NRS Chapter 630) regulates allopathic physicians (MDs) and physician assistants
- **Nevada State Board of Osteopathic Medicine** (NRS Chapter 633) regulates osteopathic physicians (DOs)

[FACT - LEGISLATION] Assembly Bill 56 (AB 56), enacted in 2025, dramatically changed DO CME requirements by increasing from 35 hours/year to 40 hours/year and maintaining annual (vs. biennial) renewal frequency. This legislation did NOT affect MD requirements.

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] This is a TIER 2 SPLIT-BOARD STATE with DRAMATIC differences in renewal frequency. Nevada is notable for having one of the most significant MD/DO renewal frequency disparities in the United States: MDs renew biennially (40 hrs/2yr) while DOs renew ANNUALLY (40 hrs/year after AB 56 2025). The two boards are statutorily distinct entities with completely different renewal schedules.

---

## 2. Lifecycle Phases & Grace Periods

### Standard Renewal Timeline

[FACT - FSMB] Nevada medical licenses (MD) are renewed on a biennial (2-year) cycle. Source: FSMB CME Requirements Database for Nevada.

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] The biennial renewal cycle for MDs contrasts sharply with the annual renewal cycle for DOs, creating different compliance calendars and CME planning horizons for the two physician types.

### Grace Period & Late Renewal Window

[CRITICAL GAP] The Nevada statute, administrative code, and publicly available board materials do not clearly specify:
- Duration of grace period for late renewal (if any)
- Late fees or penalties for renewal after expiration
- Whether practice is permitted during a grace period
- Deadline after which renewal becomes reinstatement

**Search Attempts:**
- FSMB database reviewed - no grace period information
- Nevada board website renewal page reviewed (general structure)
- NRS 630.160 (renewal statute) - citation only, full text not accessed

**Recommendation:** Contact board at (775) 688-2559 (Reno) or (702) 486-2890 (Las Vegas) to confirm grace period duration, late fees, and consequences of late renewal.

### License Expiration & Lapsed Status

[CRITICAL GAP] The consequences of allowing a license to expire beyond any grace period are not documented in available sources. Whether the license automatically lapses, requires reinstatement application, or faces other penalties is unclear.

**Recommendation:** Clarify with board what happens if renewal is not completed and what the distinction is between late renewal and reinstatement.

---

## 3. CME Requirements - Total Hours & Categories

### Total CME Hours Required

[FACT - FSMB] Nevada requires 40 hours of continuing medical education every 2 years (biennial renewal cycle) for MD physicians. Source: FSMB CME Requirements Database for Nevada.

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] The 40-hour biennial requirement is a moderate CME burden compared to other states (some require 50+ hours biennial, others 30-40 hours). Nevada's requirement aligns with many western states' CME standards.

### Scope of Specialty Requirement - 20 Hours Minimum

[FACT - FSMB] Of the 40 total hours, 20 hours must be in the physician's scope of specialty practice. Source: FSMB CME Requirements Database for Nevada.

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] This requirement ensures that half of all CME is directly relevant to the physician's clinical practice area. The remaining 20 hours may be in broader medical topics, mandatory subjects, or areas outside the primary specialty.

### Other Medical Education - 18 Hours Available

[FACT - FSMB] The remaining hours (after scope of specialty and mandatory topics) may be completed in "other medical education" including 2 hours of misuse/abuse of controlled substances/opioids for prescribers. Source: FSMB CME Requirements Database for Nevada.

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] The breakdown appears to be:
- 20 hours: Scope of specialty
- 2 hours: Medical ethics/pain/addiction (mandatory)
- 18 hours: Other medical education (including 2 hrs opioid if prescribing, plus other topics)
- Total: 40 hours

[CRITICAL GAP] The exact category structure (Category 1, Category 2, AOA equivalents) is not specified in available FSMB data. Nevada likely accepts standard ACCME Category 1 CME but may also accept Category 2 or other formats.

**Recommendation:** Research NAC 630.720 et seq. for detailed category definitions and acceptable CME formats.

### Accreditation Requirements

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] Nevada likely accepts CME from:
- ACCME (Accreditation Council for Continuing Medical Education) providers
- State medical societies with ACCME accreditation
- Hospital and health system CME programs (ACCME-accredited)
- National medical specialty society programs

[CRITICAL GAP] Whether Nevada accepts AOA (American Osteopathic Association) CME for MD physicians is unclear. Some states accept cross-accreditation; others restrict MD physicians to ACCME-only.

**Recommendation:** Confirm acceptable accrediting bodies with the board or research NAC 630.720.

---

## 4. CME Topic Requirements

### Mandatory Recurring Requirements (Biennial)

#### Medical Ethics/Pain Management/Addiction - 2 Hours Biennial

[FACT - FSMB] Nevada requires 2 hours of CME covering medical ethics, pain management, and/or addiction every 2 years. These topics are combined in a single 2-hour requirement. Source: FSMB CME Requirements Database for Nevada.

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] Physicians may satisfy this 2-hour requirement with CME that addresses any combination of:
- Medical ethics
- Pain management
- Addiction medicine
- Likely integrated courses covering multiple topics (e.g., "Ethical Considerations in Pain Management and Addiction Treatment")

#### Misuse/Abuse of Controlled Substances/Opioids - 2 Hours Biennial (Prescribers)

[FACT - FSMB] Physicians who prescribe controlled substances must complete 2 hours of CME on misuse and abuse of controlled substances and opioids every 2 years. This is included in the "other medical education" hours (18 hours available). Source: FSMB CME Requirements Database for Nevada.

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] This requirement is conditional on prescribing activity. Only physicians with DEA registration or who prescribe controlled substances need to complete this 2-hour requirement.

**Clarification:** The 2-hour opioid requirement appears separate from the 2-hour ethics/pain/addiction requirement, though there may be overlap in acceptable courses addressing both requirements simultaneously.

#### Cultural Competency/Diversity/Equity/Inclusion - 2 Hours Biennial (Psychiatrists and PAs)

[FACT - FSMB] Psychiatrists and physician assistants must complete 2 hours of cultural competency, diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) training every 2 years. Source: FSMB CME Requirements Database for Nevada.

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] This requirement is limited to specific practice types:
- Psychiatrists (MD specializing in psychiatry)
- Physician assistants (PAs, not MDs, but regulated by same board)

**Question:** Whether this requirement applies to ALL psychiatrists or only those in specific practice settings is unclear.

[CRITICAL GAP] The effective date of this cultural competency requirement is not documented. This may be a recent addition to Nevada CME requirements.

**Recommendation:** Confirm scope of cultural competency requirement (which specialties/practice types) and effective date with the board.

### Quadrennial Requirement (Every 4 Years)

#### Suicide Detection and Referral - 2 Hours Every 4 Years

[FACT - FSMB] All Nevada physicians must complete 2 hours of suicide detection and referral training every 4 years. Source: FSMB CME Requirements Database for Nevada.

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] This quadrennial (4-year) requirement means:
- Physicians must complete this training once every two renewal cycles
- The 2 hours count toward the 40-hour total in the renewal cycle when completed
- Tracking must account for 4-year cycle offset from 2-year renewal cycle

**Example:** Physician completes suicide detection training in 2024 (counts toward 2024-2026 renewal). Next required completion: 2028 (counts toward 2028-2030 renewal).

### One-Time Requirement

#### SBIRT (Screening, Brief Intervention, Referral to Treatment) - 2 Hours One-Time

[FACT - FSMB] Nevada requires 2 hours of SBIRT (Screening, Brief Intervention, and Referral to Treatment) training. This is a one-time requirement. Source: FSMB CME Requirements Database for Nevada.

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] SBIRT is an evidence-based practice for identifying and addressing substance use disorders in clinical settings. Once completed, this 2-hour requirement does not need to be repeated.

[CRITICAL GAP] The effective date for the SBIRT requirement is not documented. It is unclear when this requirement was implemented and whether it applies to all currently licensed physicians or only new licensees after a certain date.

**Recommendation:** Confirm SBIRT effective date and whether previously licensed physicians must complete this training retroactively.

### Summary of Mandatory Topics

**Recurring Requirements (Every 2 Years):**
- Scope of Specialty: 20 hours
- Medical Ethics/Pain/Addiction: 2 hours
- Opioid Misuse/Abuse: 2 hours (if prescribing controlled substances)
- Cultural Competency/DEI: 2 hours (psychiatrists and PAs only)

**Quadrennial Requirements (Every 4 Years):**
- Suicide Detection and Referral: 2 hours

**One-Time Requirements:**
- SBIRT: 2 hours

**Total Mandatory Hours (Biennial Cycle for General Practitioner, Non-Prescriber):**
- Scope of specialty: 20 hours
- Ethics/Pain/Addiction: 2 hours
- Suicide detection: 2 hours (every other cycle, average 1 hour/cycle)
- Other medical education: 16-18 hours
- **Total: 40 hours**

**Total Mandatory Hours (Biennial Cycle for Prescriber):**
- Scope of specialty: 20 hours
- Ethics/Pain/Addiction: 2 hours
- Opioid misuse/abuse: 2 hours
- Suicide detection: 2 hours (every other cycle, average 1 hour/cycle)
- Other medical education: 14-16 hours
- **Total: 40 hours**

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] The mandatory topic requirements represent a significant portion of the 40-hour total (22-24 hours for prescribers), leaving limited flexibility for purely elective CME.

---

## 5. Controlled Substance Context

### Opioid Misuse and Abuse Education

[FACT - FSMB] Physicians who prescribe controlled substances must complete 2 hours of CME on misuse and abuse of controlled substances and opioids every 2 years. Source: FSMB CME Requirements Database.

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] This requirement addresses:
- Recognition of addiction and substance use disorders
- Appropriate opioid prescribing practices
- Patient screening and risk assessment
- Referral to addiction treatment resources
- Nevada PDMP (Prescription Drug Monitoring Program) utilization

### Pain Management Education

[FACT - FSMB] The 2-hour ethics/pain/addiction requirement includes pain management as an acceptable topic. Source: FSMB CME Requirements Database.

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] Nevada's approach combines pain management with ethics and addiction, recognizing the interconnected nature of these topics in clinical practice.

### DEA MATE Act Requirement (Federal)

[CRITICAL GAP] The federal DEA MATE Act requires 8 hours of one-time training on opioid and substance use disorder for DEA-registered practitioners (effective June 27, 2023). Nevada board materials reviewed do not reference this federal requirement or clarify how it integrates with Nevada's 2-hour opioid misuse/abuse requirement.

**Recommendation:** Confirm whether Nevada recognizes MATE Act training toward state CME requirements and whether the federal 8-hour training can be applied to the state 2-hour opioid requirement.

### Prescription Drug Monitoring Program (PDMP)

[CRITICAL GAP] Nevada operates the Nevada Prescription Monitoring Program (Nevada PMP), but reviewed materials do not specify:
- Whether PDMP training is required as part of opioid CME
- PDMP query requirements before prescribing controlled substances
- Integration of PDMP training with the 2-hour opioid misuse/abuse requirement

**Recommendation:** Research NRS 453.1545 (PDMP statute) separately to determine if there are CME or operational requirements beyond the 2-hour opioid misuse/abuse CME.

### Controlled Substance Prescribing Education (NRS 630.267)

[FACT - STATUTE] NRS 630.267 addresses requirements for prescribing controlled substances and education. This statute likely contains the statutory basis for the 2-hour opioid CME requirement. (Citation only, full text not accessed)

**Recommendation:** Research NRS 630.267 for complete controlled substance prescribing education requirements and any additional provisions beyond CME.

---

## 6. Double-Credit Opportunities

### Enhanced Credit for Priority Topics

[FACT - FSMB] Nevada allows double credit (2x hours) for CME courses in the following topics:
- Geriatrics
- Medication management
- Rare diseases

Source: FSMB CME Requirements Database for Nevada ("Double credit available for geriatrics, medication management, rare diseases").

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] This double-credit provision means:
- A 5-hour course on geriatrics counts as 10 hours toward the 40-hour requirement
- A 3-hour medication management course counts as 6 hours
- A 2-hour rare disease course counts as 4 hours

**Impact:** Physicians focusing on these priority areas can satisfy Nevada CME requirements more efficiently.

**Strategic Use:** A physician could potentially complete:
- 10 hours geriatrics CME (counts as 20 hours)
- 20 hours scope of specialty
- 2 hours ethics/pain/addiction
- 2 hours opioid misuse/abuse (if prescribing)
- 0-4 hours other (to reach 40 total counting)

[CRITICAL GAP] The specific criteria for what qualifies as "geriatrics," "medication management," or "rare diseases" CME eligible for double credit are not documented. Whether courses must be specifically designated or approved for double credit is unclear.

**Recommendation:** Contact board to clarify:
- Criteria for double-credit eligible courses
- Whether courses must be pre-approved or self-designated
- Maximum hours that can be claimed via double credit
- Whether double credit applies to all CME or only certain categories

---

## 7. Audit & Verification Procedures

### Audit Approach

[CRITICAL GAP] Nevada's audit approach for CME compliance is not documented in available sources. Key unknowns:
- Random audit percentage (if any)
- For-cause audit triggers
- Audit selection methodology
- Audit notification procedures

**Recommendation:** Contact board to determine audit frequency, methodology, and physician notification procedures.

### Documentation Requirements

[CRITICAL GAP] The documentation requirements for CME verification are not specified in available sources:
- Required retention period for certificates
- Format of acceptable documentation
- Submission procedures if audited
- Penalties for CME non-compliance

**Recommendation:** Contact board for documentation retention requirements and audit submission procedures.

### CME Tracking System

[CRITICAL GAP] Nevada's official CME tracking system (if any) is not identified in available sources. Possible systems:
- CE Broker (used by many states)
- ACCME PARS (Program and Activity Reporting System)
- Nevada-specific state system
- Self-reporting with documentation retention

**Recommendation:** Confirm with board what CME tracking system, if any, is recommended or required for Nevada MD licensees.

---

## 8. Exemptions & Alternatives

### Board Certification Exemptions

[CRITICAL GAP] The FSMB database and available sources do not document whether Nevada provides CME exemptions or credits for physicians who maintain active board certification (ABMS, AOA, or other specialty boards).

**Comparison to other states:** Many states provide partial or full CME exemptions for physicians engaged in MOC (Maintenance of Certification) programs.

**Recommendation:** Research NRS 630.253 and NAC 630.720 for board certification exemption provisions, or contact board directly.

### New Licensee Provisions

[CRITICAL GAP] Whether newly licensed physicians or recent graduates receive reduced CME requirements or exemptions for their first renewal cycle is not documented in available sources.

**Recommendation:** Confirm with board whether first-time licensees have reduced CME requirements or pro-rated requirements based on licensure date within the 2-year cycle.

### Waivers and Hardship Provisions

[CRITICAL GAP] Waiver or hardship provisions for physicians unable to complete CME due to extenuating circumstances are not documented in available sources:
- Illness or disability waivers
- Military service exemptions
- Extended leave provisions
- Hardship application procedures

**Recommendation:** Research NRS 630.253 and contact board for waiver procedures and criteria.

### Inactive Status

[FACT - STATUTE] NRS 630.160 addresses "inactive status" for Nevada medical licenses. (Citation only, full text not accessed)

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] Nevada likely provides an inactive license category for physicians not actively practicing in Nevada, which may have reduced or eliminated CME requirements.

**Recommendation:** Research NRS 630.160 for inactive status provisions, CME requirements (if any) for inactive licenses, and reactivation procedures.

---

## 9. CME Tracking Systems

### Official Tracking System

[CRITICAL GAP] As noted in Section 7, Nevada's official CME tracking and reporting system is not documented in available sources. This is a significant gap affecting physician compliance and verification.

**Recommendation:** Priority contact with board to identify tracking system and reporting procedures.

### Acceptable CME Providers

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] Nevada likely accepts CME from:
- ACCME-accredited providers
- State medical societies with ACCME accreditation
- Hospital and health system CME programs (ACCME-accredited)
- National medical specialty society programs (ACCME-accredited)

[CRITICAL GAP] Whether Nevada accepts AOA-accredited CME for MD physicians is unclear.

**Recommendation:** Confirm acceptable accrediting bodies with the board or research NAC 630.720.

### Documentation Retention

[CRITICAL GAP] The required retention period for CME documentation is not specified in reviewed materials.

**Comparison to other states:** Many states require 4-6 year retention of CME certificates and documentation (often covering the current cycle plus the previous cycle).

**Recommendation:** Confirm retention requirements with board.

---

## 10. Lapsed License Reinstatement

### Reinstatement Requirements

[CRITICAL GAP] Nevada's requirements for reinstating a lapsed medical license are not documented in available sources:
- CME requirements for reinstatement (prorated? Full cycle?)
- Reinstatement fees
- Background check requirements
- Timeline limits (how long after expiration can license be reinstated?)
- Practice restrictions during reinstatement process

**Search Attempts:**
- FSMB database reviewed - no reinstatement information
- NRS 630.160 (renewal and reinstatement statute) - citation only, full text not accessed

**Recommendation:** Research NRS 630.160 for complete reinstatement procedures, or contact board for timeline limits and fee schedule.

### Distinction Between Late Renewal and Reinstatement

[CRITICAL GAP] The point at which a late renewal becomes a reinstatement (requiring more extensive procedures) is not documented.

**Recommendation:** Clarify with board the timeline after which late renewal converts to reinstatement.

---

## 11. Renewal Fees & Timeline

### Fee Structure

[CRITICAL GAP] The specific renewal fee amount for MD physicians is not documented in available sources.

**Recommendation:** Check Nevada board online renewal portal at https://medboard.nv.gov/licensees/license-renewal/ or contact board for current fee schedule.

### Late Fees and Penalties

[CRITICAL GAP] Late fees, grace period penalties, or consequences for late renewal are not documented in reviewed materials.

**Recommendation:** Confirm with board what late fees apply and grace period structure.

### Renewal Timeline

[FACT - FSMB] Licenses are renewed on a biennial (2-year) cycle. Source: FSMB CME Requirements Database.

[CRITICAL GAP] The specific renewal date structure (birth month, anniversary of licensure, calendar date, or other) is not documented in reviewed materials.

**Recommendation:** Confirm renewal date assignment methodology with the board.

---

## 12. State-Specific Requirements

### Scope of Specialty Focus (20 Hours)

[FACT - FSMB] Nevada's requirement that 20 hours (50% of total) be in the physician's scope of specialty practice is a notable state-specific focus ensuring CME relevance to clinical practice. Source: FSMB CME Requirements Database.

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] This requirement prevents physicians from completing all CME in unrelated topics and ensures ongoing competency in their primary practice area.

### Double-Credit for Priority Topics

[FACT - FSMB] Nevada's double-credit provision for geriatrics, medication management, and rare diseases is a unique state-specific incentive to encourage CME in priority public health areas. Source: FSMB CME Requirements Database.

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] These priority topics likely reflect Nevada's specific healthcare needs:
- Geriatrics: Aging population
- Medication management: Polypharmacy and medication errors
- Rare diseases: Underserved patient populations

### Quadrennial Suicide Detection Requirement

[FACT - FSMB] Nevada's 4-year cycle for suicide detection training (2 hours every 4 years) is a unique requirement structure. Most states with suicide prevention requirements mandate annual or biennial completion. Source: FSMB CME Requirements Database.

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] The 4-year cycle reduces burden while ensuring regular engagement with suicide detection and referral skills.

### SBIRT One-Time Requirement

[FACT - FSMB] Nevada's SBIRT (Screening, Brief Intervention, Referral to Treatment) one-time requirement reflects evidence-based substance use disorder screening practices. Source: FSMB CME Requirements Database.

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] SBIRT training equips all physicians to identify substance use issues early and refer to treatment, addressing Nevada's substance use public health challenges.

---

## 13. Split-Board Comparison: Nevada MD vs. DO Requirements

### DRAMATIC RENEWAL FREQUENCY DIFFERENCE POST AB 56 (2025)

[FACT - LEGISLATION/FSMB] Nevada exhibits one of the most significant MD/DO renewal frequency disparities in the United States, especially after Assembly Bill 56 (2025):

**MD Board (NSBME):** 40 hours every 2 years (biennial renewal)
**DO Board (NSBOM):** 40 hours every YEAR (annual renewal after AB 56 2025, increased from 35 hrs/year)

**Frequency Difference:** DOs must complete CME and renew ANNUALLY while MDs renew BIENNIALLY. DOs effectively complete DOUBLE the CME burden over any 2-year period (80 hours vs. 40 hours for MDs).

**AB 56 Impact:** Assembly Bill 56 (2025) increased DO requirements from 35 hours/year to 40 hours/year AND maintained annual renewal frequency. This widened the MD/DO disparity.

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] This dramatic difference makes Nevada a critical TIER 2 split-board state requiring separate research documents and distinct compliance tracking for MD vs. DO physicians. The disparity likely stems from separate statutory frameworks and different board philosophies regarding continuing competency and renewal frequency.

### Comparison Table: Nevada MD vs. DO CME Requirements

| Factor | MD Board (NSBME) | DO Board (NSBOM) - Post AB 56 | Difference |
|--------|------------------|-------------------------------|------------|
| **Board Name** | Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners | Nevada State Board of Osteopathic Medicine | Different agencies |
| **Governing Statute** | NRS Chapter 630 | NRS Chapter 633 | Different statutory chapters |
| **Total CME** | 40 hours/2yr | 40 hours/YEAR (up from 35/yr) | **DO: ANNUAL vs. BIENNIAL** |
| **Renewal Cycle** | Biennial (2 years) | **Annual (1 year)** | **DO: 2x MORE FREQUENT** |
| **CME Over 2 Years** | 40 hours | **80 hours** | **DO: DOUBLE the burden** |
| **Scope of Specialty** | 20 hours/2yr | Unknown | Unknown |
| **Category 1-A Minimum** | N/A (MD categories) | **10 hours/year AOA Cat 1-A** | **DO-specific requirement** |
| **Medical Ethics/Pain/Addiction** | 2 hours/2yr | Unknown | Unknown |
| **Opioid Misuse/Abuse** | 2 hours/2yr (prescribers) | 2 hours/year (TBD in DO research) | Likely similar content, different frequency |
| **Cultural Competency/DEI** | 2 hours/2yr (psychiatrists/PAs) | 2 hours/year (psychiatrists/PAs, TBD) | Likely similar content, different frequency |
| **Suicide Detection** | 2 hours/4yr | 2 hours/4yr (TBD) | Likely similar |
| **SBIRT** | 2 hours one-time | 2 hours one-time (TBD) | Likely similar |
| **Double Credit Opportunities** | Yes (geriatrics, medication mgmt, rare diseases) | Unknown | Unknown |
| **Recent Legislation** | No changes | **AB 56 (2025): Increased 35→40 hrs/yr** | **DO burden increased** |

### Key Differences Requiring Special Attention

#### 1. RENEWAL FREQUENCY: Biennial vs. Annual (POST AB 56)

[FACT - LEGISLATION] Assembly Bill 56 (AB 56), enacted in 2025, maintained DO annual renewal while increasing CME hours from 35/year to 40/year. MD renewal remained biennial at 40 hours/2yr. Source: Nevada state research tracker notes referencing AB 56 2025.

**Impact Analysis:**
- MDs renew once every 2 years; DOs renew EVERY YEAR
- MDs complete 40 hours over 2 years; DOs complete 40 hours EVERY YEAR (80 hours over 2 years)
- DOs face double the CME burden and double the renewal administrative burden (applications, fees, deadline tracking)
- Rules engine must track completely different renewal cycles for MD vs. DO compliance
- Physicians holding both MD and DO licenses face complex dual compliance requirements

**Statutory Basis:**
- MD requirement: NRS 630.253 (40 hours/2yr)
- DO requirement: NRS 633 (40 hours/year after AB 56 2025)

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] The annual vs. biennial renewal frequency difference is the most critical split-board distinction in Nevada. This creates dramatically different compliance calendars, CME planning strategies, and administrative burdens for MD vs. DO physicians.

#### 2. AB 56 (2025): DO Hours Increased from 35 to 40 per Year

[FACT - LEGISLATION] Prior to AB 56 (2025), DOs were required to complete 35 hours/year. AB 56 increased this to 40 hours/year, matching the MD biennial total but on an annual basis. Source: Nevada state research tracker notes.

**Impact:**
- DO physicians experienced a 14% increase in annual CME burden (35→40 hours/year)
- Over 2 years, DOs now complete 80 hours vs. MDs' 40 hours (2:1 ratio)
- Legislative intent likely to align hour amounts (40 for both) while maintaining different frequencies

#### 3. Category 1-A Minimum for DOs (10 Hours/Year)

[FACT - FSMB] DO physicians must complete a minimum of 10 hours AOA Category 1-A CME per year. Source: FSMB database note "10 hrs Category 1A" for Nevada DO requirements.

**Impact:**
- DOs must ensure specific AOA accreditation for portion of CME
- MDs do not have a Category 1-A requirement (different category structure)
- Rules engine must track different category thresholds for MD vs. DO compliance

### Research Gaps for DO Board

The following aspects of Nevada DO requirements require separate comprehensive research:
- Confirm 40 hours/year post AB 56 (effective date, transition provisions)
- Confirm 10 hours Category 1-A minimum per year
- Whether DO board has similar topic-specific requirements (scope of specialty, ethics, opioid, cultural competency, suicide, SBIRT)
- Whether DO board offers same double-credit opportunities (geriatrics, medication management, rare diseases)
- DO board CME tracking system (if different from MD)
- DO annual renewal fees and procedures
- DO board certification provisions (AOA vs. ABMS)
- Detailed provisions of AB 56 (2025) - effective date, transition rules, rationale for annual renewal maintenance

**Recommendation:** Complete separate comprehensive research document for Nevada DO requirements to fully document the dramatic annual vs. biennial frequency difference and the impact of AB 56 2025 legislation.

**Sections Fully Addressed:**
- Board information and regulatory authority ✅
- CME requirements (total hours, scope of specialty, mandatory topics) ✅
- Split-board identification and frequency difference documentation ✅
- Cross-source congruency validation ✅
- Double-credit opportunities ✅

**Sections With Gaps:**
- Lifecycle phases and grace periods - ~30% complete (grace period, late fees, lapsed license details missing)
- Controlled substance context - ~55% complete (MATE Act integration, PDMP requirements unclear)
- Audit and verification procedures - ~20% complete (system, retention, audit frequency all unclear)
- Exemptions and alternatives - ~35% complete (board cert exemptions missing, waiver procedures unclear)
- Renewal fees and timeline - ~35% complete (fee amount, renewal date methodology unclear)
- CME tracking systems - ~25% complete (system identification critical gap)
- Lapsed license reinstatement - ~30% complete (procedures and timeline unclear)
- CME category structure - ~40% complete (Category 1/2 definitions not detailed)

**Sections Not Yet Researched:**
- DO board requirements (separate document required) - 0% in this document
- AB 56 (2025) detailed provisions - 0% (needs Nevada legislative research)

**Confidence Level: MEDIUM**

The FSMB database provides reliable summary data on core requirements (hours, topics, double credit). However, Nevada-specific operational details (fees, grace periods, tracking systems, audit procedures, NAC administrative code details, AB 56 full text) require direct research of Nevada statutes, administrative code, legislation, and board contact.

**Primary strength:** Core CME hour and topic requirements clearly documented and validated across sources. Double-credit provision well-documented.

**Primary weakness:** Operational and procedural details require Nevada statute/NAC research, AB 56 legislative research, and board contact for clarification.

## Conclusion

Nevada's MD license renewal requirements are characterized by a biennial (2-year) renewal cycle with 40 hours CME, strong specialty focus, and unique double-credit incentives for priority topics. Key features include:

1. **40 Hours Biennial:** Moderate CME burden with 50% in scope of specialty (20 hours)
2. **Mandatory Recurring Topics:** Ethics/Pain/Addiction (2 hrs), Opioid Misuse/Abuse (2 hrs for prescribers), Cultural Competency (2 hrs for psychiatrists/PAs)
3. **Quadrennial Suicide Detection:** 2 hours every 4 years (unique timing structure)
4. **One-Time SBIRT:** 2 hours (substance use disorder screening)
5. **Double Credit:** Geriatrics, medication management, rare diseases eligible for 2x hours
6. **DRAMATIC SPLIT-BOARD FREQUENCY DIFFERENCE:** DO physicians renew ANNUALLY (40 hrs/year, 80 hrs over 2 years) vs. MD biennial (40 hrs/2yr) after AB 56 2025

**For Physician Compliance:** Track biennial renewal cycle (date TBD with board), complete 40 hours total with 20 hours in scope of specialty, ensure completion of mandatory topics (ethics/pain/addiction, opioid if prescribing, suicide detection every 4 years, SBIRT one-time, cultural competency if psychiatrist), consider double-credit opportunities for geriatrics/medication management/rare diseases, maintain documentation (retention period TBD with board).

**For Rules Engine Implementation:** Nevada requires:
- Separate tracking for MD (biennial, 40 hrs/2yr) vs. DO (annual, 40 hrs/year post AB 56)
- Scope of specialty hour tracking (20-hour minimum)
- Mandatory topic hour tracking (ethics/pain/addiction 2, opioid 2 if prescriber, cultural competency 2 if psychiatrist/PA)
- Quadrennial cycle tracking for suicide detection (2 hours every 4 years, offset from 2-year renewal)
- One-time requirement flag for SBIRT (once completed, never required again)
- Double-credit calculation for priority topics (geriatrics, medication management, rare diseases)
- Prescriber conditional logic for opioid CME
- Specialty conditional logic for cultural competency CME

**Critical Next Steps:**
1. Contact board for operational details (fees, grace periods, tracking system, retention requirements, renewal date methodology)
2. Clarify double-credit criteria (what qualifies, maximum hours, pre-approval requirements)
3. Clarify cultural competency scope (which specialties beyond psychiatrists)
4. Clarify SBIRT effective date (retroactive vs. prospective)
5. Complete separate DO research document to fully document annual renewal frequency and AB 56 2025 impact
6. Research Nevada NAC 630.720 et seq. for CME category definitions and procedural details
7. Research Assembly Bill 56 (2025) for complete DO requirement changes, effective dates, and legislative rationale
8. Research Nevada PDMP statute (NRS 453.1545) for controlled substance prescribing CME integration

**TIER 2 Split-Board Status Confirmed:** Nevada requires separate MD and DO research documents due to DRAMATIC renewal frequency difference (biennial vs. annual) and the significant impact of AB 56 2025 legislation doubling DO CME burden over any 2-year period (80 vs. 40 hours).
