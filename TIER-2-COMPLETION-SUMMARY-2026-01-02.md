## Tennessee Split-Board Analysis (TN-M vs TN-O)

### Shared Requirements (Identical)
- **Total CME Hours:** 40 hrs/2yr (biennial)
- **Controlled Substance CME:** 2 hrs mandatory (Tennessee DOH guidelines: opioids, benzodiazepines, barbiturates, carisoprodol)
- **Federal MATE Act:** 8 hrs one-time training (DEA registrants, effective 6/27/23)
- **Renewal Timing:** **Biennial birthday renewal** (last day of birth month) — both boards use same system
- **Grace Period:** 60 days with $200 late fee → automatic revocation day 61
- **CME Tracking:** CE Broker (voluntary, automatic audit pass if current)
- **Documentation Retention:** 4 years from end of calendar year
- **Board Cert Exemption:** Pain management, anesthesiology, PM&R, neurology, rheumatology (from 2-hr controlled substance requirement only)

### Key Differences

| Factor | MD (TN-M) | DO (TN-O) | Impact |
|--------|-----------|-----------|--------|
| **CME Categories** | AMA Category 1 only (all 40 hrs) | AOA mix: I-A unlimited, II-A unlimited, I-B max 20 hrs | **CRITICAL** - Different category compliance algorithms required |
| **Renewal Fee** | $310 ($300 + $10 state regulatory) | $410 | DO pays $100 more per cycle |
| **Reinstatement Exam** | Not specified after lapse | May be required after 3 years | DO-specific requirement |
| **Regulatory Code** | Tenn. Comp. R. & Regs. 0880-02 | Tenn. Comp. R. & Regs. 1050-02 | Separate regulatory frameworks |

### Critical Tracker Correction
**FINDING:** Tennessee DO renewal is **birthday-based biennial** (same as MD), **NOT** December 31 fixed date.

**Evidence:**
- Tenn. Comp. R. & Regs. 1050-02-.07: "license expiration date is 'the last day of the month in which a license holder's birthday falls' under the biennial birthdate renewal system"
- Both TN-M and TN-O use identical renewal timing structure
- Tracker has been updated to reflect correct information

## Vermont Split-Board Analysis (VT-M vs VT-O)

### Shared Requirements (Identical)
- **Total CME Hours:** 30 hrs/2yr (lower than most states)
- **Controlled Substance CME:** 2 hrs (DEA registrants only)
- **Federal MATE Act:** 8 hrs one-time (DEA registrants, effective 6/27/23)
- **Renewal Date:** November 30 of even years (fixed date, not birthday-based)
- **Grace Period:** **NONE** - immediate license lapse upon expiration
- **CME Category:** Category 1 only (strict)

### Key Differences

| Factor | MD (VT-M) | DO (VT-O) | Impact |
|--------|-----------|-----------|--------|
| **Regulatory Agency** | Vermont Dept of Health, Board of Medical Practice | Vermont Secretary of State, Office of Professional Regulation (OPR) | **CRITICAL** - Completely separate agencies |
| **Osteopathic Education** | Not required | 40% minimum (12 hrs) osteopathic medical education | DO-specific requirement |
| **Board Size** | 17 members (9 physicians, 1 PA, 1 podiatrist, 6 public) | 5 members (3 DOs, 2 public) | Different governance structures |
| **Mandatory Topics** | 1 hr palliative/hospice/pain care | Same (inferred) | Both require controlled substance CME |
| **Renewal Fee** | $525 | Not documented | Gap in DO fee information |
| **Portal** | https://mpb.health.vermont.gov/login.aspx | https://sos.vermont.gov/opr/online-services/ | Different online systems |
| **Phone** | (802) 657-4223 | (802) 828-1505 | Different board contacts |

### Unique Vermont Feature
**NO GRACE PERIOD:** Vermont is one of the strictest states for renewal deadlines. Both MD and DO licenses lapse immediately upon November 30 expiration with no grace period for late renewal.

---

## Critical Gaps Documented

### Tennessee (Both MD and DO)
1. Audit frequency percentage not disclosed
2. Waiver criteria for hardship not published
3. Pain clinic exemption regulatory basis unclear
4. PDMP integration with controlled substance CME
5. Military service exemptions not documented
6. New licensee first renewal exemption limited (USMLE Step 3 calendar year only)

### Vermont (Both MD and DO)
1. Late renewal penalty amounts unclear (no grace period, but reinstatement fees unknown)
2. Audit frequency not specified
3. New licensee pro-rata CME calculations not documented
4. Board certification exemptions not found
5. Military exemptions not documented
6. Waiver criteria for hardship not published

### DO-Specific Gaps
**Tennessee DO:**
- Reinstatement exam requirement after 3 years (DO-specific, not found in MD statute)
- Late renewal fee during grace period unclear

**Vermont DO:**
- Renewal fee amounts not documented
- Osteopathic education minimum definition (40% = 12 hrs confirmed, but content requirements unclear)

---

## Split-Board Patterns Identified

### Pattern 1: Same Agency, Different Categories
**Tennessee:** Both boards under Tennessee Department of Health, but MD uses AMA Category 1 only while DO uses AOA category mix. Same renewal timing and fees differ by $100.

### Pattern 2: Different Agencies, Same Renewal Date
**Vermont:** MD under Department of Health, DO under Secretary of State OPR. Completely separate regulatory structures but share November 30 even-year renewal date. DO has osteopathic education minimum (40%).

### Pattern 3: Mandatory Topic Consistency
Both Tennessee and Vermont maintain identical controlled substance prescribing requirements (2 hrs) for both MD and DO boards, plus identical federal MATE Act requirements (8 hrs one-time for DEA registrants).

### Pattern 4: Board Certification Exemptions
Tennessee provides specialty-specific exemptions from 2-hr controlled substance requirement (pain management, anesthesiology, PM&R, neurology, rheumatology) for both MD and DO. Vermont board cert exemptions not documented.

## Comparison: Tennessee vs Vermont

| Factor | Tennessee (TN) | Vermont (VT) |
|--------|----------------|--------------|
| **CME Hours** | 40 hrs/2yr | 30 hrs/2yr (lower) |
| **Renewal Timing** | Birthday-based (individual dates) | November 30 even years (fixed) |
| **Grace Period** | 60 days ($200 late fee) | **NONE** (immediate lapse) |
| **Regulatory Structure** | Same agency (TN Dept Health), separate boards | Different agencies (Health vs SOS) |
| **Osteopathic Requirement** | Category mix only | 40% osteopathic education (12 hrs) |
| **Mandatory Topics** | 2 hrs controlled substance (all) | 1 hr palliative/pain + 2 hrs controlled substance (DEA only) |
| **Fee Difference (MD vs DO)** | $100 (DO higher: $410 vs $310) | Unknown (MD $525, DO TBD) |
| **CME Tracking** | CE Broker (both boards) | No unified system; separate portals |

## Recommendations for Rules Engine Implementation

### Tennessee-Specific Logic
1. **Category Validation:**
   - MD: Verify all 40 hrs are AMA Category 1
   - DO: Verify AOA category mix (I-A + II-A + I-B ≤ 20 hrs)

2. **Renewal Date Calculation:**
   - Use licensee birth month (same for MD and DO)
   - Calculate last day of birth month
   - Track 60-day grace period

3. **Fee Structure:**
   - MD: $310 standard, $510 late
   - DO: $410 standard, late fee TBD (assume similar $200 penalty)

### Vermont-Specific Logic
1. **Osteopathic Education Minimum (DO only):**
   - Require ≥12 hrs (40%) osteopathic medical education
   - Track separately from general Category 1 requirement

2. **Renewal Date (Both):**
   - Fixed: November 30 of even years
   - **NO grace period** - immediate lapse warning required

3. **Agency Routing:**
   - MD: Route to VT Dept of Health portal
   - DO: Route to VT Secretary of State OPR portal

4. **Fee Tracking:**
   - MD: $525 confirmed
   - DO: Fee not documented (flag for manual entry)

### Recommended Follow-Up
1. Contact Tennessee Board of Medical Examiners to clarify:
   - Audit frequency percentage
   - Late renewal fee amount for DO (during grace period)
   - Pain clinic exemption regulatory basis
   - PDMP CME integration details

2. Contact Vermont boards to clarify:
   - DO renewal fee amounts
   - Late renewal/reinstatement fees (no grace period scenario)
   - Board certification exemption policies
   - Osteopathic education content requirements (40% minimum)

3. Consider next TIER-2 states for research:
   - **California** (CA-M/CA-O): Already complete per tracker
   - **Florida** (FL-M/FL-O): Already complete per tracker
   - **Pennsylvania** (PA-M/PA-O): Already complete per tracker
   - **Arizona** (AZ-M/AZ-O): Already complete per tracker
   - **Maine** (ME-M/ME-O): UNASSIGNED - dramatic difference (40 vs 100 hrs)
   - **Washington** (WA-M/WA-O): UNASSIGNED - different cycles (4yr vs 3yr)
   - **West Virginia** (WV-M/WV-O): UNASSIGNED - reverse pattern (50 vs 32 hrs)
   - **Michigan** (MI-M/MI-O): UNASSIGNED
   - **Nevada** (NV-M/NV-O): UNASSIGNED - DO requirement doubled (40/yr)
   - **Oklahoma** (OK-M/OK-O): UNASSIGNED - dramatic difference (60/3yr vs 16/yr)
