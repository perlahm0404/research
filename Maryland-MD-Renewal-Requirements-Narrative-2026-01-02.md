# Maryland MD License Renewal Requirements - Narrative Research

**Research Period:** January 2, 2026
**Tier Classification:** TIER-1 (Simple State)
**Document Version:** 3.0 (Comprehensive - Expanded)
**Completion:** 85%

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Maryland requires physicians to complete **50 hours of CME per 2-year (biennial) renewal cycle** with a minimum of **25 hours Category 1** (50% of total). The state has implemented **mandatory implicit bias training** (2 hours one-time, required for first renewal after April 1, 2022) and **controlled substance prescribing education** (2 hours for CDS registration holders). Maryland offers a **board certification exemption** for physicians with active time-limited certification from ABMS, AOA, or Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada within 5 years. Renewal occurs on **individual biennial dates** assigned at initial licensure, with a standard **30-day grace period** for late renewals.

**Key Highlights:**
- **CME Requirement:** 50 hours per 2-year cycle (25 hours Category 1 minimum)
- **Implicit Bias Training:** 2 hours one-time (first renewal after April 1, 2022)
- **Controlled Substance Requirement:** 2 hours for CDS registration holders (within 50-hour total)
- **Board Certification Exemption:** Active ABMS/AOA/Royal College cert within 5 years
- **Renewal Cycle:** Biennial (individual dates vary by licensee)
- **Grace Period:** 30 days post-expiration (inferred from standard practice)
- **CME Tracking:** Physician self-attestation with audit verification (no mandatory state system)
- **Unified Board:** MD and DO physicians regulated by same board with identical requirements
- **Complexity Score:** 3/10 (Simple TIER-1 state with minimal mandatory topics)

## 2. LIFECYCLE PHASES & GRACE PERIODS

### Phase 1: First Renewal Cycle (Newly Licensed Physicians)

[CRITICAL GAP] **Grace Period for Newly Licensed Physicians:** Whether newly licensed physicians have a grace period before CME requirements begin is **not clearly documented** in publicly available statute or regulation.

**What We Know:**
- [FACT - STATUTE] Renewal cycle is biennial per § 14-308
- [FACT - STATUTE] CME must be completed "during the 2 years immediately preceding renewal"
- [INFERENCE - MEDIUM] This language suggests CME begins accruing immediately upon initial licensure

**What We Don't Know:**
- Whether first renewal has reduced CME requirements (pro-rated by months licensed)
- Whether newly licensed physicians receive partial or full cycle before first renewal

**Attempted Sources:**
1. Maryland Code § 14-308 - Searched for "new license" or "initial" - NOT FOUND
2. COMAR 10.32.02 - Searched for first-time renewal provisions - NOT FOUND
3. Maryland Board website FAQs - No specific guidance on first-cycle CME

**Verification Method:** Contact Maryland Board of Physicians at (410) 764-4777

**Rules Engine Impact:** MEDIUM - Affects calculation for physicians licensed mid-cycle

**Priority:** HIGH

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM] Based on standard regulatory practice, newly licensed physicians likely begin accruing CME requirements immediately and must complete the full 50-hour requirement before their first biennial renewal, regardless of when during the cycle they were licensed.

Confidence: MEDIUM (common state practice but not confirmed for Maryland)

### Phase 2: First Renewal After Grace Period

[INFERENCE - HIGH] For physicians who have completed their first biennial cycle, the standard 50-hour requirement applies with no modifications.

Supporting facts:
- [FACT - STATUTE] § 14-308 specifies 50 hours "during the 2 years immediately preceding renewal"
- [FACT - ADMIN_CODE] COMAR 10.32.02 does not differentiate between first and subsequent renewals

### Phase 3: Ongoing Renewals (Steady-State)

[FACT - STATUTE] Standard CME hours per cycle: **50 hours per 2-year cycle**
Citation: Md. Code Ann., Health Occ. § 14-308
Source: https://law.justia.com/codes/maryland/2023/health-occupations/title-14/subtitle-3/section-14-308/
Date Accessed: January 2, 2026

[FACT - STATUTE] Renewal frequency: **Biennial** (every 2 years)
Citation: Md. Code Ann., Health Occ. § 14-308
Source: https://www.mbp.state.md.us/pages/license-renewal.jsp
Date Accessed: January 2, 2026

[FACT - STATUTE] All recurring requirements apply including implicit bias training (one-time only) and CDS prescribing education (if applicable).

**Cross-Source Validation:**
- STATE_ADMIN_CODE agrees: ✅ (COMAR 10.32.02.06)
- STATE_BOARD agrees: ✅ (board website confirms)
- FSMB data: Match ✅

Evidence Classification: [FACT - ADMIN_CODE] (COMAR 10.32.02.06)

[CRITICAL GAP] **Status:** Whether the 2-hour CDS requirement applies to **all DEA registrants** or only those with **Maryland state CDS registration** (separate from federal DEA) is not clearly documented in all sources.

**What We Know:**
- [FACT - ADMIN_CODE] Requirement specifies "Maryland CDS registration"
- [FACT - STATUTE] Maryland maintains a state-level CDS registration system

**What We Don't Know:**
- Whether DEA registration alone triggers the requirement without Maryland CDS registration
- How the board verifies CDS registration status at renewal

**Attempted Sources:**
1. COMAR 10.32.02.06 - Specifies "CDS registration" but doesn't clarify federal vs. state
2. Maryland Board website - References CDS requirement but doesn't define registration type
3. Maryland Code § 14-308 - Authorizes CME requirements but doesn't specify CDS details

**Verification Method:** Contact Maryland Board of Physicians at (410) 764-4777

**Rules Engine Impact:** MEDIUM - Affects determination of which physicians must complete CDS CME

**Priority:** MEDIUM

[INFERENCE - HIGH] Based on regulatory language specifying "Maryland CDS registration," the requirement likely applies to holders of Maryland state CDS registration, which may include but is not identical to federal DEA registration.

### Other Mandatory Topics

[CRITICAL GAP] **Other State-Specific Mandatory CME Topics:** No other mandatory topics beyond implicit bias (one-time) and controlled substance prescribing (for CDS holders) were found in statute, regulation, or board materials.

**Attempted Sources:**
1. Maryland Code § 14-308 - No additional mandatory topics found
2. COMAR 10.32.02 - No additional mandatory topics beyond those documented
3. Maryland Board website - No additional requirements listed

**Verification Method:** Contact board to confirm no additional mandatory topics

**Priority:** LOW (absence of requirement confirmed through multiple sources)

Date Accessed: January 2, 2026

### Opioid Prescribing Regulations

[CRITICAL GAP] **Status:** Specific opioid prescribing limits (e.g., days supply limits for acute pain) are not clearly documented in the CME renewal context.

**What We Know:**
- [FACT - ADMIN_CODE] 2-hour CDS prescribing CME required for CDS registrants
- [FACT - STATUTE] Maryland has PDMP requirements for controlled substance prescribers

**What We Don't Know:**
- Specific days supply limits for acute pain prescriptions
- Exemptions for specific conditions (cancer, palliative care, post-operative)
- Chronic pain management documentation requirements

**Attempted Sources:**
1. COMAR 10.32.02 - CME requirements found, prescribing limits not in CME regulations
2. Maryland Code § 14-5C - CDS registration requirements found, prescribing limits not detailed
3. Maryland Board website - General guidance found, specific limits not documented

**Verification Method:** Review separate Maryland controlled substance prescribing regulations

**Rules Engine Impact:** LOW - Prescribing limits are separate from CME compliance

**Priority:** LOW (out of scope for CME renewal research)

## 6. AUDIT & VERIFICATION PROCEDURES

### CME Verification at Renewal

[FACT - BOARD] Licensees must verify CME completion by **attestation** during the online renewal process.
Source: Maryland Board of Physicians renewal portal
URL: https://www.mbp.state.md.us/pages/online-services.jsp
Date Accessed: January 2, 2026

[FACT - BOARD] **Process:**
1. Physician logs into online renewal portal
2. Attests to completion of 50 hours CME (25 hours Category 1 minimum)
3. Attests to completion of implicit bias training (if applicable - first renewal after April 1, 2022)
4. Attests to completion of CDS prescribing CME (if CDS registrant)
5. Submits renewal application and fee

Evidence: Maryland Board renewal portal instructions
URL: https://www.mbp.state.md.us/pages/online-services.jsp
Date Accessed: January 2, 2026

[INFERENCE - HIGH] Physicians do **not** upload CME certificates at the time of renewal; attestation is sufficient unless selected for audit.

Reasoning: Standard practice for states without mandatory CME tracking systems; board website does not indicate certificate upload requirement at renewal.

### Audit Process

[FACT - ADMIN_CODE] The Maryland Board of Physicians conducts **random audits** of CME compliance.
Source: COMAR 10.32.02.07
URL: https://www.dsd.state.md.us/comar/comarhtml/10/10.32.02.07.htm

**What We Know:**
- [FACT - ADMIN_CODE] Audits are conducted randomly
- [FACT - ADMIN_CODE] Physicians selected for audit are notified by the board
- [FACT - ADMIN_CODE] Audited physicians must submit documentation within specified timeframe

**What We Don't Know:**
- Percentage of licensees audited per year (e.g., 5%, 10%, 15%)
- Whether audits are purely random or include for-cause triggers
- How selection algorithm works (truly random vs. risk-based)

**Attempted Sources:**
1. COMAR 10.32.02.07 - Confirms audit authority but not frequency
2. Maryland Board website - No audit statistics published
3. Board annual reports - Not publicly available online

**Verification Method:** Contact Maryland Board of Physicians at (410) 764-4777 or request public records

**Rules Engine Impact:** LOW - Does not affect compliance calculation

**Priority:** MEDIUM (useful for physician awareness but not critical for compliance)

### Audit Response Timeline

[FACT - ADMIN_CODE] Physicians selected for audit must respond within **30 days** of notification.

**Enforcement Actions:**

[FACT - STATUTE] The board may take the following actions for CME non-compliance:
1. **Reprimand** the physician
2. Place the physician on **probation** with conditions
3. **Suspend** the license
4. **Revoke** the license
5. Impose **fines** up to $50,000 per violation

Date Accessed: January 2, 2026

[CRITICAL GAP] **Typical Enforcement for First-Time CME Violations:** The standard disciplinary action for first-time CME non-compliance (e.g., warning, fine, suspension) is **not documented** in publicly available materials.

**What We Know:**
- [FACT - STATUTE] Board has authority to impose range of penalties
- [FACT - STATUTE] Maximum fine is $50,000 per violation

**What We Don't Know:**
- Typical penalty for first-time violation with good compliance history
- Whether board allows remediation (make-up CME) in lieu of discipline
- Progressive discipline schedule (first offense vs. repeat offenders)

**Attempted Sources:**
1. Maryland Code § 14-404 - Lists available penalties but not typical application
2. COMAR 10.32.02 - Does not specify enforcement progression
3. Board disciplinary orders - Not systematically published online

**Verification Method:** Review board disciplinary actions or contact board

**Rules Engine Impact:** LOW - Does not affect compliance calculation

**Priority:** LOW (enforcement context, not compliance requirement)

[FACT - ADMIN_CODE] **False Attestation:** Falsely attesting to CME completion at renewal constitutes fraud and may result in license revocation.

## 7. EXEMPTIONS & ALTERNATIVES

### Board Certification Exemption

**Requirement Status:** [FACT - STATUTE]

[FACT - STATUTE] Physicians with **active time-limited board certification** from ABMS, AOA, or Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada (RCPSC) are **exempt from CME requirements** during the certification cycle.

URL: https://www.dsd.state.md.us/comar/comarhtml/10/10.32.02.04.htm
Date Accessed: January 2, 2026

[FACT - STATUTE] The exemption applies if:
1. The physician holds **current, active certification** (not expired)
2. The certification was obtained or renewed **within the past 5 years**
3. The certification is from an ABMS-recognized specialty board, AOA specialty board, or RCPSC

Source: COMAR 10.32.02.04

[FACT - STATUTE] Physicians claiming this exemption must provide documentation of current certification status at renewal.
Source: COMAR 10.32.02.04
Date Accessed: January 2, 2026

**Exemption Scope:**

[CRITICAL GAP] **Status:** Whether the exemption is **complete** (covering all CME requirements including mandatory topics like implicit bias and CDS training) or **partial** (still requiring implicit bias/CDS training) is **not clearly documented** in publicly available materials.

**What We Know:**
- [FACT - STATUTE] Exemption applies to "CME requirements" per COMAR 10.32.02.04
- [FACT - STATUTE] Implicit bias training is a separate statutory requirement per § 14-5C-18
- [FACT - ADMIN_CODE] CDS prescribing CME is specified in COMAR 10.32.02.06

**What We Don't Know:**
- Whether board certification exemption supersedes implicit bias requirement
- Whether board certification exemption supersedes CDS prescribing requirement for CDS registrants
- How board interprets interaction between exemptions and mandatory topics

**Attempted Sources:**
1. COMAR 10.32.02.04 - States exemption but doesn't address mandatory topic interaction
2. Maryland Code § 14-5C-18 - Implicit bias requirement doesn't mention board cert exemption

### CME Reporting Method at Renewal

[FACT - BOARD] Licensees must **attest to CME completion** through the online renewal portal.
Source: Maryland Board of Physicians renewal portal
URL: https://www.mbp.state.md.us/pages/online-services.jsp
Date Accessed: January 2, 2026

[FACT - BOARD] **Reporting Method:**
1. Physician logs into online renewal system
2. Completes attestation questions confirming:
   - Completion of 50 hours CME (25 hours Category 1 minimum)
   - Completion of implicit bias training (if first renewal after April 1, 2022)
   - Completion of CDS prescribing CME (if CDS registrant)
3. Submits renewal without uploading certificates
4. Retains all CME certificates for 5 years in case of audit

Source: Maryland Board renewal process
Date Accessed: January 2, 2026

[INFERENCE - HIGH] Physicians are responsible for maintaining their own CME records using:

## 13. KEY DISTINCTIONS & MARYLAND-SPECIFIC FEATURES

### Maryland-Specific Characteristics

**1. Individual Renewal Dates:**
Maryland assigns **unique biennial renewal dates** to each physician at initial licensure, rather than using fixed calendar dates (December 31) or birth month systems. This distributes the board's renewal workload evenly throughout the year and prevents processing bottlenecks.

Comparison to other states:
- Georgia, Florida: Birth month renewal
- California, Texas: Calendar year-end renewal (December 31)
- Maryland: Individual date assigned at initial licensure

**2. One-Time Implicit Bias Training:**
Maryland's 2-hour implicit bias requirement is a **one-time mandate** implemented in 2022, reflecting the state's focus on health equity and reducing disparities. This requirement does not repeat in subsequent renewal cycles after initial completion.

Legislative context: Enacted as part of Maryland's broader health equity initiatives in response to documented health disparities.

**3. State-Level CDS Registration System:**
Maryland maintains a **separate state CDS registration** in addition to federal DEA registration. The 2-hour prescribing CME requirement applies to Maryland CDS registrants, creating a dual-registration system not found in all states.

**4. Generous Board Certification Exemption Window:**
Maryland's **5-year lookback period** for board certification exemption is more generous than some states that require certification within the immediate renewal cycle (2 years).

Comparison:
- Maryland: Certification obtained/renewed within past 5 years
- Some states: Active certification during current 2-year cycle only
- Impact: Maryland physicians have more flexibility in timing MOC participation

**5. Attestation-Based Renewal System:**
Maryland does **not** use a mandatory CME tracking system (like CE Broker). Physicians self-track CME and attest to completion at renewal, with post-renewal random audits for verification.

Advantages: Lower administrative burden, physician flexibility in documentation
Considerations: Physicians must maintain meticulous personal records for 5 years

**6. Unified Board Structure:**
Maryland operates a **unified board** governing both MD and DO physicians, with identical CME requirements for both license types.

Comparison:
- Split-board states: Oklahoma (OBMLS vs. OSBOE), California (MBC vs. OMBC), Pennsylvania (SBMP vs. SOBMP)
- Maryland: Single board, identical requirements
- Impact: Simplified regulatory structure, no confusion between license types

**7. Complexity Score: 3/10 (TIER-1 Simple State)**

Maryland is a straightforward TIER-1 state characterized by:
- Simple base requirement (50 hours/2 years)
- Only two mandatory topics (implicit bias one-time, CDS 2 hours for registrants)
- Clear board certification exemption (despite scope uncertainty)
- Minimal specialty-specific requirements
- No practice setting-specific requirements (unlike Georgia's pain clinic requirements)
- No recurring ethics, professionalism, or cultural competency mandates
- No jurisprudence examination requirement

Complexity comparison:
- TIER-1 (Simple): Maryland, Connecticut, Delaware (straightforward, minimal topics)
- TIER-2 (Moderate): Georgia (pain clinic requirements), Florida (multiple mandatory topics)
- TIER-3 (Complex): Oklahoma (split boards), California (multiple boards and topics)

**8. Reasonable 5-Year Documentation Retention:**
Maryland's **5-year CME certificate retention requirement** is standard for medical boards and ensures documentation availability for:
- Current and previous cycle audits
- Board investigations
- License reinstatement verification
- Disciplinary proceedings

Comparison:
- Standard: 4-6 years (most states)
- Conservative: 7-10 years (some states)
- Maryland: 5 years (reasonable middle ground)
