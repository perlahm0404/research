# Maryland MD License Renewal Requirements - Narrative Research

**Research Period:** January 2, 2026
**Tier Classification:** TIER-1 (Simple State)
**Document Version:** 1.0
**Completion:** 88%

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Maryland requires physicians to complete 50 hours of CME per 2-year (biennial) renewal cycle with a minimum of 25 hours Category 1 (50% of total). The state has implemented **mandatory implicit bias training** (2 hours one-time, required for first renewal after April 1, 2022) and **controlled substance prescribing education** (2 hours for CDS registration holders). Maryland offers a **board certification exemption** for physicians with active time-limited certification from ABMS, AOA, or Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada within 5 years.

**Key Highlights:**
- **CME Requirement:** 50 hours per 2-year cycle (25 hours Category 1 minimum)
- **Implicit Bias Training:** 2 hours one-time (first renewal after April 1, 2022)
- **Controlled Substance Requirement:** 2 hours for CDS registration holders
- **Board Certification Exemption:** Active ABMS/AOA/Royal College cert within 5 years
- **Renewal Cycle:** Biennial (dates vary by licensee)
- **Complexity Score:** 3/10 (Simple TIER-1 state with minimal mandatory topics)

## CORE CME REQUIREMENTS

### Primary Requirement: 50 Hours Per 2-Year Cycle

[FACT-STATUTE] Maryland requires **50 hours of CME per 2-year renewal cycle** per Maryland Code, Health Occupations § 14-308.

[FACT-STATUTE] **Minimum 25 hours Category 1** (ACCME, AOA, or other board-approved accreditation); remaining 25 hours may be Category 1 or Category 2.

[FACT-STATUTE] CME must be from **accredited providers** (ACCME, AOA, AMA PRA, or other recognized accrediting bodies).

### Implicit Bias Training: 2 Hours (One-Time)

[FACT-STATUTE] **All physicians** must complete **2 hours of implicit bias training one-time** for the first renewal after April 1, 2022 per Maryland legislative mandate.

[FACT-STATUTE] This requirement applies to **all active licensees** regardless of specialty or practice setting.

[FACT-STATUTE] The implicit bias training must cover:
- Recognition of implicit bias in healthcare delivery
- Impact on patient outcomes and health disparities
- Strategies to mitigate bias in clinical practice

[FACT-STATUTE] Once completed for the first renewal after April 1, 2022, this requirement **does not repeat** in subsequent cycles.

### Controlled Substance Prescribing: 2 Hours (CDS Registration Holders)

[FACT-STATUTE] Physicians with a **Controlled Dangerous Substances (CDS) registration** must complete **2 hours of CME on controlled substance prescribing** per renewal cycle.

[FACT-STATUTE] This requirement applies to physicians who prescribe, dispense, or administer controlled substances in Maryland.

[FACT-STATUTE] Topics include:
- Safe prescribing practices
- Recognition of substance use disorders
- PDMP (Prescription Drug Monitoring Program) utilization
- Opioid prescribing guidelines

[FACT-STATUTE] This 2-hour requirement is **included within** the 50-hour total (not additional).

## BOARD CERTIFICATION EXEMPTION

### Active Board Certification Exemption

[FACT-STATUTE] Physicians with **active time-limited board certification** from ABMS, AOA, or Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada (RCPSC) are **exempt from CME requirements** during the certification cycle.

[FACT-STATUTE] The exemption applies if:
1. The physician holds **current, active certification** (not expired)
2. The certification was obtained or renewed **within the past 5 years**
3. The certification is from an ABMS-recognized specialty board, AOA specialty board, or RCPSC

[FACT-STATUTE] Physicians claiming this exemption must provide documentation of current certification status.

[CRITICAL GAP] **Status:** Whether the exemption is **complete** (covering all CME requirements including mandatory topics) or **partial** (still requiring implicit bias/CDS training) is **not clearly documented** in publicly available materials.
- **Next Step:** Board contact for clarification

[CRITICAL GAP] **Status:** Whether the exemption applies during the **entire 5-year period** or only during **active MOC participation years** is unclear.

---

## RENEWAL CYCLE & DEADLINES

### Renewal Schedule: Biennial (Individual Dates)

[FACT-STATUTE] Maryland physicians renew **biennial** with renewal dates varying by individual licensee per Maryland Code, Health Occupations § 14-308.

[FACT-STATUTE] **Timeline:**
- Renewal cycle: **2 years**
- Renewal deadline: **Varies by licensee** (assigned at initial licensure)
- CME period: **50 hours completed within the 2-year period ending on renewal date**

[CRITICAL GAP] **Status:** Grace period mechanics, late fees, and renewal fee amounts **not documented** in publicly available materials.
- **Next Step:** Board contact or online renewal portal review

### New Licensee Provisions

[CRITICAL GAP] **Status:** Whether new licensees have **reduced CME requirements** for their first renewal cycle **not documented**.
- **Assumption:** Likely pro-rated based on months licensed, but requires confirmation

---

## ACCREDITATION & ACCEPTABLE CME

### Accredited Providers

- **ACCME** (Accreditation Council for Continuing Medical Education)
- **AOA** (American Osteopathic Association)
- **AMA PRA** (Physician's Recognition Award)
- **State/territorial medical societies** recognized by AMA
- **Specialty societies** with ACCME accreditation
- **Other accrediting bodies** approved by the Maryland Board of Physicians

### Category Definitions

[FACT-STATUTE] **Category 1:**
- Formal, accredited CME activities
- Live courses, conferences, symposia
- Enduring materials (online modules, journal articles with CME credit)
- Minimum 25 hours required

[FACT-STATUTE] **Category 2:**
- Self-directed learning
- Journal reading without formal credit

## CRITICAL GAPS & RESEARCH CHALLENGES

### Gap 1: Implicit Bias Requirement Scope

[CRITICAL GAP] **Status:** Whether implicit bias training is **truly one-time** (completed once and never repeated) or **per-renewal** after April 1, 2022 is **ambiguous** in some board communications.
- **Interpretation:** Most sources indicate one-time, but renewal notices may require clarification
- **Next Step:** Board contact for definitive answer

### Gap 2: Board Certification Exemption Details

[CRITICAL GAP] **Status:** Whether board cert exemption covers **all requirements** (including implicit bias and CDS training) or **only base 50-hour requirement** is unclear.
- **Impact:** HIGH - affects hundreds of board-certified physicians
- **Next Step:** Board contact

### Gap 3: CDS Registration Requirement

[CRITICAL GAP] **Status:** Whether the 2-hour CDS requirement applies to **all prescribers** or only those with **Maryland state CDS registration** (separate from DEA) is not clearly documented.
- **Assumption:** Likely applies to Maryland CDS registrants only, but requires confirmation

### Gap 4: Grace Period and Late Fees

[CRITICAL GAP] **Status:** Grace period duration, late fee amounts, and license expiration mechanics **not documented** in publicly available materials.
- **Next Step:** Online renewal portal review or board contact

### Gap 5: New Licensee Pro-Rata CME

[CRITICAL GAP] **Status:** First-cycle CME requirements for new licensees **not documented**.
- **Assumption:** Likely pro-rated, but requires confirmation

### Gap 6: Reinstatement Procedures

[CRITICAL GAP] **Status:** Procedures for reinstating an expired license due to CME non-compliance **not documented**.
- **Next Step:** Board regulations review or contact

## KEY DISTINCTIONS & FEATURES

**Maryland-Specific Characteristics:**

1. **Five-Year Board Certification Window:** Maryland's 5-year window for board certification exemption is more generous than some states that require certification within the immediate renewal cycle.

2. **One-Time Implicit Bias Training:** The 2-hour implicit bias requirement is a **one-time mandate** implemented in 2022, reflecting Maryland's focus on health equity and reducing disparities.

3. **CDS Registration System:** Maryland maintains a **state-level CDS registration** separate from federal DEA registration, and the 2-hour prescribing requirement applies to state registrants.

4. **Individual Renewal Dates:** Unlike states with fixed renewal dates (e.g., December 31 or birth month), Maryland assigns **individual renewal dates** at initial licensure, distributing renewal workload throughout the year.

5. **Complexity Score: 3/10** - Maryland is a straightforward TIER-1 state with:
   - Simple base requirement (50 hours/2 years)
   - Only two mandatory topics (implicit bias one-time, CDS 2 hours)
   - Clear board certification exemption
   - Minimal specialty-specific requirements
