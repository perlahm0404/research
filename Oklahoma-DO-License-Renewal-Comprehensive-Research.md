              ## Section B: Unified Board Status & DO Equivalence

              ### Why Oklahoma DOs Have Identical Requirements to MDs

              Oklahoma's unified medical board structure means:

              1. **Single Statute Governs Both:** The Oklahoma Allopathic Medical and Surgical Licensure and Supervision Act applies equally to MDs and DOs
             
              2. 2. **Same CME Requirements:** DOs must complete the identical 60 hours every 3 years as MDs
                
                 3. 3. **Same Pain Management Requirement:** The mandatory 1 hour pain management/opioid education applies to DOs
                   
                    4. 4. **Same Application Disclosures:** DOs must report all nine categories of information on renewal applications
                      
                       5. 5. **Same Penalties & Compliance:** Identical fines, disciplinary procedures, and non-compliance consequences
                         
                          6. 6. **Same Renewal Portal:** DOs use the same OBMLS Online License Renewal system as MDs
                            
                             7. ### Contrast with Split-Board States
                            
                             8. Many states maintain **separate boards** for:
                             9. - MDs (Allopathic Medical Board)
                                - - DOs (Osteopathic Medical Board)
                                 
                                  - These separate boards often have different CME requirements and renewal procedures. **Oklahoma does NOT follow this model.**
                                 
                                  - ### Evidence Classification
                                  - - **[FACT]** Unified board structure confirmed via okmedicalboard.org website search results
                                    - - **[FACT]** Same statute (Title 59, §59-495a.1) applies to both MDs and DOs
                                      - - **[INFERENCE]** Therefore, all CME, application, and compliance requirements detailed in the MD research document apply identically to DOs
                                       
                                        - ---

                                        **Frequency:** Annual (prior to each renewal application)

                                        **Effective Date:** November 1, 2019

                                        **Note on Accreditation:** DOs can satisfy CME requirements through AOA (American Osteopathic Association) accredited courses or AMA accredited courses, as both provide Category 1 CME credit accepted by Oklahoma.

                                                                              ### Phase 1: Initial Notification
                                                                              Board mails renewal notice to DO licensee

                                                                              ### Phase 3: Submission & Attestation
                                                                              DO signs and attests to application accuracy; submits via OBMLS portal

                                                                              ### Phase 4: Board Review
                                                                              Board reviews form; may request additional documentation; evaluates fitness to practice

                                                                              ### Phase 6: Post-Renewal
                                                                              Updated license information available on public search via okmedicalboard.org

                                                                              **Status:** OUT OF SCOPE - Per research protocol

                                                                              **Applicable To:** DOs completing initial license term

                                                                              **CME Requirements:** 60 hours for previous registration period (or applicable portion)

                                                                              **Unique Requirements:** [CRITICAL GAP] No differentiation found for first DO renewal; appears identical to subsequent renewals

                                                                              **Standard Requirements:**

                                                                                  - - All disclosure and attestation requirements per 59-495a.1(A)-(E)

                                                                                          ## Section J: DO-Specific Considerations

                                                                                          ### Osteopathic Manipulation Training (OMT)

                                                                                          **Note:** Oklahoma's statute does not specify differential credit for OMT training or require OMT-specific CME hours. DOs must meet the same 60-hour Category 1 CME requirement as MDs without specialized osteopathic-only requirements visible in the statute.

                                                                                          **[CRITICAL GAP]** Whether AOA-accredited osteopathic manipulation training or osteopathic principles courses satisfy CME requirements should be verified with the Board, as Board rules (OAC 435-15) may provide clarification.

                                                                                          ### Dual Licensure Possibilities

                                                                                          DOs with osteopathic and allopathic training in states that offer both would still only need one Oklahoma license through the unified board.

                                                                                          ### Evidence Classification
