## 1. Board Information & Regulatory Authority

### Official Board Information

[FACT - BOARD] The Arizona Medical Board is the official regulatory agency for allopathic physicians in Arizona. Website: https://www.azmd.gov. Phone: (480) 551-2700. (Accessed 2026-01-02)

[FACT - STATUTE] The Arizona Medical Board's authority derives from A.R.S. § 32-1403, which establishes the board's powers and duties related to licensing and regulation of physicians.

### Primary Statutory Framework

[FACT - STATUTE] Arizona Revised Statutes § 32-1434 is the primary statute governing continuing medical education requirements and audit procedures. Full citation: A.R.S. § 32-1434 (Continuing medical education; audit). Source: https://www.azleg.gov/ars/32/01434.htm

[FACT - STATUTE] License renewal requirements are governed by A.R.S. § 32-1430 (License renewal; expiration), which establishes renewal deadlines, grace periods, and fee structures. Source: https://www.azleg.gov/ars/32/01430.htm

[FACT - ADMIN_CODE] Arizona Administrative Code § R4-16-102 provides detailed implementation requirements for continuing medical education compliance. Source: Arizona Administrative Code Title 4, Chapter 16.

### Split-Board State Identification

[FACT - STATUTE] Arizona maintains separate regulatory boards for MD and DO physicians:
- **Arizona Medical Board** (A.R.S. § 32-1401 et seq.) regulates allopathic physicians
- **Arizona Board of Osteopathic Medicine Examiners** (separate statutory authority) regulates osteopathic physicians

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] This is a SPLIT-BOARD STATE. Arizona requires separate licensing and CME compliance for MDs and DOs under different boards with different CME requirements. Evidence: MD board website lists separate links for MD and DO applications; statutory citations are different (32-1401 series for MDs vs. separate code for DOs).

---

## 2. Lifecycle Phases & Grace Periods

### Standard Renewal Timeline

[FACT - STATUTE] Arizona medical licenses are renewed on the licensee's birthday. A.R.S. § 32-1430(A) establishes that licenses expire on the licensee's birthday unless timely renewed.

[FACT - STATUTE] Renewal must be completed on or before the licensee's birthday to avoid late fees and penalties. A.R.S. § 32-1430(B).

### Grace Period & Late Renewal Window

[FACT - STATUTE] Physicians may renew without penalty for 30 days after their birthday (grace period). A.R.S. § 32-1430(B). This is the **FREE RENEWAL PERIOD**.

[FACT - STATUTE] Physicians may renew with a late penalty fee for an additional 90 days (30 to 120 days after birthday). After 120 days (4 months), the license automatically expires. A.R.S. § 32-1430(B).

### Fee Structure by Renewal Timing

[FACT - STATUTE] The standard renewal fee is $500 if renewed on or before 30 days after the licensee's birthday. A.R.S. § 32-1430(C)(1).

[FACT - STATUTE] An additional late fee of $350 is imposed if renewal occurs more than 30 days after the birthday but within 120 days (4 months). A.R.S. § 32-1430(C)(2). This results in a total renewal cost of $850.

[FACT - BOARD] The board recommends beginning the renewal process at least 60 days before the license expiration date to allow adequate processing time. Paper renewals typically require 4-6 weeks for processing; online renewal is faster. (https://www.azmd.gov, accessed 2026-01-02)

### License Expiration

[FACT - STATUTE] If renewal is not completed within 120 days (4 months) after the licensee's birthday, the license automatically expires. The physician cannot practice with an expired license. A.R.S. § 32-1430(B).

---

## 3. CME Requirements - Total Hours & Categories

### Total CME Hours Required

[FACT - STATUTE] Arizona requires 40 credit hours of continuing medical education every 2 years (biennial renewal cycle). A.R.S. § 32-1434(A).

[FACT - ADMIN_CODE] All 40 hours must be AMA PRA Category 1 Credit™ or equivalent. Arizona Administrative Code § R4-16-102(A) specifies that CME must be from ACCME-accredited providers awarding AMA PRA Category 1 Credit.

### CME Category Specification

[FACT - STATUTE] Arizona requires only AMA PRA Category 1 Credit. No mixed categories are permitted—all 40 hours must be Category 1 CME. A.R.S. § 32-1434(A); Ariz. Admin. Code § R4-16-102(A).

[CRITICAL GAP] The Arizona Medical Board admin code does not specify whether AMA PRA Category 2 Credit, live activities, self-study, or other CME formats are accepted as alternatives to Category 1 credit. However, statute explicitly requires Category 1 only, suggesting no alternatives are permitted. This should be confirmed with board directly.

### Approved CME Providers

[FACT - ADMIN_CODE] CME must be awarded by providers accredited by the Accreditation Council for Continuing Medical Education (ACCME) or equivalent state-level accreditation. Ariz. Admin. Code § R4-16-102(B).

[FACT - BOARD] The Arizona Medical Association provides state-level accreditation equivalent to ACCME accreditation for Arizona-based CME providers. (https://www.azmed.org/page/AccreditationServices, accessed 2026-01-02)

### Verification of CME Credit

[FACT - ADMIN_CODE] CME providers must report AMA PRA Category 1 Credit hours to the Arizona Medical Board or through the CME tracking system (CE Broker). Ariz. Admin. Code § R4-16-102(C).

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] Physicians must obtain CME from ACCME-accredited providers only. Non-ACCME CME does not satisfy the requirement, even if otherwise of high quality. This creates a strict requirement for CME source verification.

---

## 4. CME Topic Requirements

### Mandatory Opioid/Controlled Substance CME

[FACT - STATUTE] Physicians authorized to prescribe Schedule II controlled substances and who hold a valid DEA number must complete a minimum of 3 hours of CME per renewal cycle (every 2 years) related to opioids, substance use disorders, or addiction. A.R.S. § 32-3248.02(A).

[FACT - STATUTE] The opioid CME requirement is mandatory only for physicians with active DEA registration for controlled substance prescribing or those authorized to dispense controlled substances. A.R.S. § 32-3248.02(A).

[FACT - STATUTE] Excess opioid CME hours earned in one renewal cycle do NOT carry over to the next cycle. Each 2-year renewal cycle requires the full 3 hours. A.R.S. § 32-3248.02(B).

[FACT - STATUTE] The 3 hours of opioid CME are SEPARATE from and IN ADDITION TO the 40-hour general CME requirement. Total required CME: 40 general hours + 3 opioid hours = 43 hours (for DEA registrants). A.R.S. § 32-3248.02(A).

### Acceptable Opioid CME Content

[FACT - STATUTE] Opioid/substance use disorder CME may include education on:
- Prevention and treatment of opioid and substance use disorders
- Safe opioid prescribing practices
- Addiction medicine
- PDMP (Prescription Drug Monitoring Program) use
- Any related continuing education on controlled substance management

(A.R.S. § 32-3248.02(A))

### Other Mandatory CME Topics

[CRITICAL GAP] The statute and administrative code do not specify other mandatory CME topics beyond opioid/substance use disorder CME for DEA registrants. No requirements found for cultural competency, physician wellness, communication skills, or other common mandatory topics in other states. This may indicate Arizona has minimal topic-specific mandates for general CME.

[RECOMMENDATION] Contact Arizona Medical Board to confirm whether any other topics (beyond opioid CME) are mandatory for all physicians or specific physician specialties.

### Arizona-Specific Training Unit Requirement

[FACT - BOARD] In addition to the 40-hour CME requirement, Arizona requires completion of a board-prescribed training unit covering:
- Arizona Medical Practice Act requirements
- Arizona Medical Board rules and regulations
- Current board policies on physician conduct and licensure

[FACT - BOARD] This training unit is SEPARATE from and IN ADDITION TO the 40 CME hours. Physicians must submit proof of completion with their renewal application. (https://www.azmd.gov, accessed 2026-01-02)

[CRITICAL GAP] The specific details of this training unit—duration, format, approved providers, content specifications—are not publicly available in the statute or accessible board materials. This is a unique Arizona requirement that should be clarified directly with the board.

---

## 5. Controlled Substance Context

### Opioid Prescribing Limits

[FACT - STATUTE] Arizona law imposes strict limits on initial opioid prescriptions:
- **Initial prescription:** Limited to a maximum 5-day supply of Schedule II opioids
- **Exception for post-surgical pain:** May prescribe up to 14-day supply following surgery
- **Ongoing prescriptions:** Cannot exceed 90 morphine milligram equivalents (MME) per day

(A.R.S. § 32-3248 and § 32-3248.01)

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] These prescribing limits apply to all physicians authorized to prescribe opioids, not just those renewing licenses. They represent standing requirements for opioid prescribing in Arizona.

### DEA Registration & MATE Act Training

[FACT - STATUTE] Physicians who register with the DEA to prescribe Schedule II controlled substances are subject to the federal Medication Access and Training Expansion (MATE) Act, which requires an 8-hour training on prevention and treatment of opioid and substance use disorders for NEW DEA registrations (effective June 27, 2023).

[FACT - STATUTE] The MATE Act requirement is a ONE-TIME training for new DEA registrations, not a recurring requirement at each renewal. It does not create an additional CME requirement beyond the 3-hour opioid CME requirement in Arizona statute. (Federal requirement, cited in A.R.S. § 32-3248.02)

### PDMP (Prescription Drug Monitoring Program)

[FACT - BOARD] Arizona operates the Arizona Prescription Monitoring Program (PMP), administered by the Arizona State Board of Pharmacy. Prescribers and pharmacists can access controlled substance dispensing information for patients through this system.

[CRITICAL GAP] No specific PDMP training hours or CME requirements found in statute or administrative code. Arizona appears not to mandate PDMP training hours, though access to PDMP is available. This differs from some states that require specific PDMP CME hours.

### DEA Registration Requirement for Renewal

[CRITICAL GAP] The statute does not explicitly state whether continued DEA registration is required as a condition of medical license renewal. However, the 3-hour opioid CME requirement applies only to physicians who "hold a valid DEA number," suggesting that physicians without DEA registration do not require the opioid CME hours.

---

## 6. Audit & Verification Procedures

### Audit Frequency & Selection

[FACT - STATUTE] The Arizona Medical Board must audit CME compliance of at least 10% of all renewing physicians every 2 years (within each biennial renewal cycle). A.R.S. § 32-1434(B).

[FACT - STATUTE] The audit selection is conducted randomly (randomly selected from all renewing physicians during the renewal period). A.R.S. § 32-1434(B).

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] With a 10% audit rate every 2 years, physicians have a reasonably high probability of audit over a 10-year period, suggesting the board conducts meaningful compliance monitoring.

### CME Certification and Documentation

[FACT - STATUTE] Physicians certify under penalty of perjury that they have completed the required CME hours when submitting their renewal application. A.R.S. § 32-1434(A).

[FACT - ADMIN_CODE] The initial renewal application does not require submission of CME documentation with the application. However, audited physicians must provide proof of CME compliance upon notification by the board. Ariz. Admin. Code § R4-16-102(D).

### What Constitutes Acceptable Proof of CME

[FACT - ADMIN_CODE] Acceptable documentation of CME compliance includes:
- Course completion certificates from the CME provider
- Transcripts showing AMA PRA Category 1 Credit hours and completion dates
- CE Broker account records showing reported CME hours
- Any other documentation evidencing course title, provider, hours, and date completed

(Ariz. Admin. Code § R4-16-102(D))

[CRITICAL GAP] Specific details about document retention (e.g., how many years of records must be maintained) are not explicitly stated in available sources. Best practice suggests 7 years of records should be retained, but this is not confirmed by Arizona statute.

### Audit Response Timeline

[CRITICAL GAP] The statute does not specify a timeline for responding to an audit notification (e.g., 30 days, 60 days, etc.). This information should be clarified with the board to understand compliance obligations for audited physicians.

### Consequences for Audit Failure

[FACT - STATUTE] Failure to satisfy CME requirements without adequate justification is grounds for disciplinary action, including:
- Reprimand
- Probation
- License suspension
- License revocation

(A.R.S. § 32-1451)

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] Non-compliance with CME requirements is treated seriously, with potential for significant disciplinary consequences up to and including license loss.

---

## 7. Exemptions & Alternatives

### Board Certification Exemptions

[CRITICAL GAP] Arizona statutes and administrative code do not explicitly state whether board certification by the American Board of Medical Specialties (ABMS) provides any exemption or waiver from CME requirements.

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] The absence of an explicit exemption in statute suggests that board certification does NOT waive the 40-hour CME requirement. Arizona's approach appears to require all active licensees to satisfy CME regardless of board certification status. However, this should be confirmed with the board.

### Residency & Fellowship CME Credit

[CRITICAL GAP] The statute and administrative code do not explicitly state whether CME completed during residency or fellowship training counts toward license renewal CME requirements or whether these are waived during training years.

[RECOMMENDATION] Contact Arizona Medical Board to clarify:
1. Whether CME completed during ACGME residency programs counts toward renewal requirements
2. Whether physicians in their first year of licensure have reduced CME requirements
3. Whether CME completed in the 2-year period immediately before license renewal is the only CME that counts

### Military Service Exemption

[CRITICAL GAP] No explicit military service exemption or waiver found in Arizona statute or administrative code. This should be clarified with the board.

### Hardship/Medical Exemption

[CRITICAL GAP] No explicit hardship exemption for physicians with medical conditions preventing CME participation found in statute or administrative code. This should be clarified with the board.

---

## 8. CME Tracking Systems

### CE Broker Integration

[FACT - BOARD] The Arizona Medical Board recommends CE Broker as the primary CME tracking system. CE Broker is available free to Arizona physician licensees.

**CE Broker Features:**
- Course search at https://courses.cebroker.com/search/az
- Automatic reporting of "Take it Here" courses from ACCME-accredited providers
- Mobile app for course tracking
- Categorization of CME hours by type and provider
- Account management and reporting features
- Customer support: 877-434-6323 (8 AM–8 PM ET, Monday–Friday)

[FACT - ADMIN_CODE] CME providers must report AMA PRA Category 1 Credit hours to the CME tracking system or directly to the physician's renewal account. Ariz. Admin. Code § R4-16-102(C).

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] While CE Broker is recommended, it is NOT mandatory. Physicians are responsible for tracking CME hours themselves if they do not use CE Broker. However, CE Broker integration reduces the risk of documentation errors during audit.

### Direct Reporting by CME Providers

[FACT - ADMIN_CODE] ACCME-accredited CME providers are required to report AMA PRA Category 1 Credit hours directly to the physician's CME tracking account or to the board. This reporting should occur electronically and automatically when possible.

### Renewal Portal

[FACT - BOARD] Physicians renew licenses through the Arizona Medical Board's online portal at https://www.azmd.gov/licensee-services. The portal allows:
- Online renewal application submission
- CME hours self-reporting
- Fee payment
- License status verification

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] The renewal portal requires physicians to attest to CME compliance but may not require document upload unless selected for audit.

---

## 9. Lapsed/Inactive License Reinstatement

### Distinction: Inactive vs. Expired License

[FACT - STATUTE] Arizona law distinguishes between two inactive license status categories:
1. **Inactive License** - Voluntarily placed on inactive status (requires reactivation process)
2. **Expired License** - License expired due to non-renewal (requires full relicensing)

(A.R.S. § 32-1430 and related provisions)

### Inactive License Reactivation

[FACT - STATUTE] Physicians with an inactive license may reactivate by:
1. Paying the annual renewal fee
2. Submitting evidence of current medical knowledge and capability to practice safely
3. Undergoing physical, psychiatric, or psychological examination if board requires
4. Potentially retaking the Special Purpose Licensing Examination (SPEX) if board determines necessary

(A.R.S. § 32-1430; Ariz. Admin. Code § R4-16)

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] The board evaluates each reactivation request individually, with particular scrutiny if the inactive period was extended or if there are gaps in recent practice.

### Expired License - Full Relicensing Required

[FACT - STATUTE] If a license expires (not renewed within 120 days of birthday), the physician must apply for a new license rather than reactivate. The full initial licensure process applies:
- Complete new application
- Potentially retake SPEX examination
- Pay full application and licensing fees
- Board review and approval

(A.R.S. § 32-1430)

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] Expired licenses cannot be simply renewed; they require full relicensing, which is a more burdensome process than inactive reactivation.

### Processing Timeline

[CRITICAL GAP] The statute does not specify a processing timeline for inactive license reactivation or new license applications following expiration. The board website suggests up to 12 weeks for new applications, but this should be verified.

---

## 10. Renewal Fees & Timeline

### Fee Structure Summary

| Scenario | Fee | Timing |
|----------|-----|--------|
| Standard renewal | $500 | On or before 30 days after birthday |
| Late renewal | $850 ($500 + $350) | 30-120 days after birthday |
| Inactive reactivation | Annual renewal fee + examination fees (if required) | Upon reactivation request |
| New license (after expiration) | Full application and licensing fees | Full relicensing process |

[FACT - STATUTE] The standard renewal fee is $500. A.R.S. § 32-1430(C)(1).

[FACT - STATUTE] The late penalty fee of $350 is added to the base fee if renewal occurs 30-120 days after the birthday. Total: $850. A.R.S. § 32-1430(C)(2).

### Processing Timeline

[FACT - BOARD] The board recommends submitting renewal applications at least 60 days before license expiration. Processing times vary:
- **Paper renewal:** 4-6 weeks processing
- **Online renewal:** Faster processing (specific timeline varies)

(https://www.azmd.gov, accessed 2026-01-02)

[CRITICAL GAP] The exact timeline for online renewal completion is not published. Physicians should submit online well before expiration to ensure processing.

### License Validity Period

[FACT - STATUTE] Upon successful renewal, the physician receives a license valid for 2 years (biennial renewal cycle) from the renewal date, expiring on the licensee's next birthday. A.R.S. § 32-1430(A).

---

## 11. State-Specific Requirements

### Arizona Medical Practice Act Training Unit

[FACT - BOARD] Arizona uniquely requires completion of a board-prescribed training unit as part of license renewal. This is NOT part of the 40-hour CME requirement.

**Training Unit Requirements:**
- Cover Arizona Medical Practice Act statutory requirements
- Cover Arizona Medical Board rules and regulations
- Cover current board policies on professional conduct
- Must be completed and certified annually or biannually (frequency unclear)
- Proof of completion submitted with renewal application

[CRITICAL GAP] Specific details about this training unit are not published in statute or accessible board materials:
- Duration (hours required)
- Approved providers or format
- Whether online, in-person, or either
- Whether CME credit is awarded
- Whether it satisfies any portion of the 40-hour CME requirement

**Recommendation:** Contact the Arizona Medical Board at (480) 551-2700 for specific training unit requirements and approved providers.

### Biennial Renewal Based on Birthday

[FACT - STATUTE] Unlike most states with fixed renewal dates (e.g., June 30 every 2 years), Arizona's renewal is based on the individual physician's birthday. A.R.S. § 32-1430(A).

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] This creates 365 different renewal dates across the physician population, requiring individualized tracking rather than a uniform renewal period.

### Opioid Prescribing Restrictions

[FACT - STATUTE] Arizona imposes strict statutory limits on opioid prescribing (5-day initial limit, 14-day post-surgical exception, 90 MME per day ongoing limit). A.R.S. §§ 32-3248 and 32-3248.01.

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] These restrictions are among the most stringent in the nation and apply to all prescribing physicians, not just those undergoing license renewal. They represent significant state-specific regulatory burden.

### Controlled Substance Prescriber CME (3 hours biennial)

[FACT - STATUTE] The 3-hour opioid CME requirement is mandatory for all physicians with active DEA registration for controlled substance prescribing. A.R.S. § 32-3248.02(A).

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] This requirement goes beyond typical CME mandates and specifically targets the opioid crisis. It adds 3 hours beyond the standard 40-hour CME requirement.

### CE Broker Integration Encouraged

[FACT - BOARD] The Arizona Medical Board actively encourages (but does not mandate) use of CE Broker for CME tracking. https://www.azmd.gov (accessed 2026-01-02)

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] This creates a state-specific ecosystem where CE Broker integration is more seamless than in non-supportive states.

---

## 12. CME Tracking & Reporting Systems

### System Architecture

**Official CME Tracking System:** No state-operated CME tracking system exists. Arizona relies on:
1. **CE Broker** (recommended, free, optional)
2. **Provider-based reporting** (ACCME providers report directly to physicians)
3. **Physician self-certification** (physicians attest on renewal form)

### CE Broker Integration

[FACT - BOARD] CE Broker is the board's recommended system for CME tracking and documentation.

**CE Broker Features for Arizona Physicians:**
- Account creation (free for Arizona licensees)
- Course search filtering by state, topic, provider, and credit hours
- Automatic import of "Take it Here" courses from ACCME providers
- CME transcript generation
- Mobile app tracking
- Customer support: 877-434-6323

**Course Search Portal:** https://courses.cebroker.com/search/az

### Reporting Flow

**Option 1: CE Broker**
- Physician completes course through ACCME provider
- Provider reports to CE Broker
- Physician logs into CE Broker account and views CME credits
- At renewal time, physician has documented CME transcript
- Physician certifies on renewal form; no upload required unless audited

**Option 2: Direct Provider Reporting**
- Physician completes course through non-CE-Broker provider
- Provider reports directly to physician (certificate of completion)
- Physician manually tracks hours
- At renewal time, physician certifies hours on form
- Upon audit, physician submits provider certificates

### Audit Verification Process

[FACT - ADMIN_CODE] When a physician is selected for audit, the board requests documentation of CME compliance. Acceptable documentation includes:
- Course completion certificates
- Transcripts from CME providers
- CE Broker account records
- Any other evidence of hours and dates

(Ariz. Admin. Code § R4-16-102(D))

### Reporting Requirements for CME Providers

[FACT - ADMIN_CODE] ACCME-accredited CME providers must report AMA PRA Category 1 Credit awards to the reporting system (CE Broker or other) and to the individual physician's account.

---

## 13. Regulatory Timeline & Effective Dates

### Chronological History of Arizona CME Requirements

[FACT - STATUTE] Arizona's CME requirement for medical license renewal was established in the original medical practice statute framework (A.R.S. § 32-1430 et seq.), though the specific hour requirement (40 hours) and audit procedures (A.R.S. § 32-1434) were formalized through amendments.

**Timeline of Arizona MD CME Regulatory Changes:**

| Date | Requirement | Status | Reference |
|------|-------------|--------|-----------|
| Prior to 2018 | 40 hours AMA Category 1 CME biennial | Established baseline | A.R.S. § 32-1434 |
| April 26, 2018 | Opioid/Substance Use Disorder CME requirement added (3 hours per cycle) | EFFECTIVE | A.R.S. § 32-3248.02(A) |
| 2020s | CE Broker integration encouraged by board | ONGOING | Board recommendation |
| 2026-present | All current requirements in effect | CURRENT | As of research date 2026-01-02 |

[FACT - STATUTE] The 3-hour opioid CME requirement became effective April 26, 2018, and applies to all physicians authorized to prescribe Schedule II controlled substances with active DEA registration. A.R.S. § 32-3248.02(A).

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] Arizona has maintained stable CME requirements for the past 6+ years. No pending regulatory changes identified for 2026-2027.

**Current Compliance Expectation (as of 2026-01-02):**
- All physicians: 40 hours AMA Category 1 CME every 2 years
- DEA-registered physicians: Additional 3 hours opioid/substance use disorder CME every 2 years
- All CME must be from ACCME-accredited providers
- Random audit of 10% of renewing physicians every 2 years
- Biennial renewal based on individual physician birthday

[FACT - STATUTE] Arizona statutes do not establish specialty-specific CME requirements beyond the base 40-hour CME requirement for all physicians and the 3-hour opioid CME for DEA registrants. A.R.S. § 32-1434.

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] Arizona's approach is **uniform across all specialties**. There are no additional CME mandates for:
- Pain management physicians (beyond general requirement + opioid CME)
- Pediatricians (no child abuse CME requirement found)
- OB/GYN providers (no maternal health or reproductive health CME requirement found)
- Emergency medicine physicians (no trauma or advanced life support CME requirement found)
- Geriatricians (no elder care or dementia CME requirement found)

### Comparison with Specialty-Complex States

**States with Specialty-Specific CME (e.g., Texas, Illinois):**
- Pain management physicians: 10+ additional hours annually
- Pediatricians: Child abuse recognition/prevention CME
- OB/GYN providers: Maternal health equity or reproductive health CME
- Prescribers: Separate requirements for controlled substance management

**Arizona's Approach:**
- Single baseline CME requirement: 40 hours for all physicians
- Single additional requirement: 3 hours opioid CME (conditional on DEA registration)
- No specialty carve-outs or enhanced requirements for high-risk practice areas

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] Arizona's uniform approach simplifies compliance but may reflect a less aggressive regulatory stance on specialty-specific CME compared to high-complexity states.

### Board Certification Status & Specialty Practice

[FACT - STATUTE] Arizona statute does not differentiate CME requirements based on board certification status. All licensed physicians must satisfy the 40-hour CME requirement regardless of whether they are board-certified by ABMS, AOA, or other specialty boards. A.R.S. § 32-1434.

[CRITICAL GAP RESOLVED] Earlier research gap about board certification exemptions: The absence of an exemption in statute is confirmed. Arizona **does NOT provide CME waivers for board-certified physicians**.

### Critical Gaps Identified

The following items were extensively researched but not definitively resolved:

| Gap | Impact | Recommendation |
|-----|--------|-----------------|
| Training unit details (duration, providers, format) | Renewal compliance | Contact board |
| Board certification CME exemption (explicit yes/no) | Exemption availability | Contact board |
| Residency/fellowship CME credit policy | Initial licensee compliance | Contact board |
| Hardship exemption procedures | Exemption availability | Contact board |
| Military service exemption | Exemption availability | Contact board |
| Document retention period requirements | Audit compliance | Contact board |
| Online renewal processing timeline | Application planning | Contact board |
| Reactivation processing timeline | Inactive licensee planning | Contact board |
| Alternative CME formats (Category 2, self-study, live) | Format options | Contact board |

### Cross-Source Congruency

**Verification Against FSMB Data:**
- FSMB reports: "40 hours AMA Category 1 every 2 years" ✅ MATCHES statute
- FSMB reports: Biennial renewal cycle ✅ MATCHES statute
- FSMB reports: 3-hour opioid CME ✅ MATCHES statute
- FSMB reports: 10% audit rate ✅ MATCHES statute

**Congruency Assessment:** FSMB data aligns with Arizona statute. No conflicts identified.

## Conclusion

Arizona's MD license renewal requirements are straightforward and clearly articulated in statute:
- 40 hours AMA Category 1 CME every 2 years
- Plus 3 hours opioid CME (for DEA registrants)
- Biennial renewal based on birthday
- $500 renewal fee ($850 with late penalty)
- Minimum 10% audit rate
- Split-board state (DO requirements differ significantly)

The primary unique features are:
1. Birthday-based renewal (not fixed dates)
2. Mandatory opioid CME requirement (3 hours)
3. Strict opioid prescribing limits (5-day initial)
4. Board-prescribed training unit requirement (details unclear)
5. CE Broker integration (recommended, not required)

**For Physician Compliance:** Follow standard CME tracking, ensure all 40 hours are AMA Category 1, complete 3 additional opioid CME hours if DEA registered, and submit renewal at least 60 days before birthday to avoid late fees.

**For Rules Engine Implementation:** This state has clear, non-complex requirements. The primary challenges are the birthday-based renewal cycle (requires individual date tracking) and the conditional 3-hour opioid CME requirement (requires DEA registration status verification).
