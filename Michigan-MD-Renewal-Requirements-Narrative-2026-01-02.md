# Michigan MD License Renewal Requirements - Comprehensive Research

## Executive Summary

The Michigan Board of Medicine regulates allopathic physicians (MDs) in Michigan. Key requirements:

- **CME Requirement:** 150 hours every 3 years (triennial cycle)
- **Category 1 Minimum:** 75 hours must be Category 1 CME (50% of total)
- **Renewal Cycle:** Triennial (3 years)
- **Mandatory Topics:**
  - Medical Ethics: 1 hour per renewal cycle (recurring)
  - Pain and Symptom Management: 3 hours per renewal cycle (recurring)
  - Implicit Bias: 2 hours for new applicants (one-time); 1 hour annually for renewal applicants (effective June 1, 2022)
- **CRITICAL SPLIT-BOARD DIFFERENCE:** DO physicians have same 150-hour total but only require 60 hours Category 1 (vs. 75 for MDs)
- **Board Certification Provision:** ABMS board certification (if not meeting other CME) provides maximum 30 hours credit
- **Renewal Fee:** Varies by license type (specific amount TBD)
- **Grace Period:** Not documented in available sources
- **Audit:** Not documented in available sources

**TIER 2 CLASSIFICATION RATIONALE:** Michigan is a split-board state with different Category 1 requirements for MD (75 hours) vs. DO (60 hours) despite the same 150-hour total. Additionally, DO board has human trafficking training requirement not found for MDs. This represents a significant difference in CME category structure requiring separate tracking.

## 1. Board Information & Regulatory Authority

### Official Board Information

[FACT - BOARD] The Michigan Board of Medicine is the official regulatory agency for allopathic physicians in Michigan, operating under the Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs (LARA), Bureau of Professional Licensing. Website: https://www.michigan.gov/lara/bureau-list/bpl/occ/prof/medicine. Phone: (517) 335-0918. Mailing Address: Bureau of Professional Licensing, P.O. Box 30670, Lansing, MI 48909. (Based on FSMB data and Michigan government structure)

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] The board operates within LARA's Bureau of Professional Licensing, which handles licensing, renewal, and regulatory functions for multiple health professions in Michigan.

### Primary Statutory Framework

[FACT - STATUTE] The board's authority derives from the Michigan Public Health Code, specifically:
- **MCL 333.16201 et seq.** - Health Professions Article (general licensing provisions)
- **MCL 333.17001 et seq.** - Medicine (physician-specific provisions)
- **MCL 333.16204** - Licensure renewal requirements

[FACT - ADMIN_CODE] Michigan administrative rules for the Board of Medicine are codified in Michigan Administrative Code R 338.7001 et seq. (Medicine - General Provisions). These rules implement the statutory requirements.

### Split-Board State Identification

[FACT - STATUTE] Michigan maintains separate regulatory boards for MD and DO physicians:
- **Michigan Board of Medicine** (MCL 333.17001 et seq.) regulates allopathic physicians (MDs)
- **Michigan Board of Osteopathic Medicine and Surgery** (MCL 333.16501 et seq.) regulates osteopathic physicians (DOs)

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] This is a TIER 2 SPLIT-BOARD STATE with critical differences in Category 1 CME requirements. While both boards require 150 hours/3yr total, MDs must complete 75 hours Category 1 while DOs need only 60 hours Category 1. The two boards are statutorily distinct entities with different CME requirement structures.

---

## 2. Lifecycle Phases & Grace Periods

### Standard Renewal Timeline

[FACT - FSMB] Michigan medical licenses are renewed on a triennial (3-year) cycle. License expiration dates are assigned based on the licensee's birth date. Source: FSMB CME Requirements Database for Michigan.

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] The triennial renewal cycle means physicians renew less frequently than states with annual or biennial renewal, but must complete more CME hours (150) within the 3-year period.

### Grace Period & Late Renewal Window

[CRITICAL GAP] The Michigan statute, administrative code, and publicly available board materials do not clearly specify:
- Duration of grace period for late renewal (if any)
- Late fees or penalties for renewal after expiration
- Whether practice is permitted during a grace period
- Deadline after which renewal becomes reinstatement

**Search Attempts:**
- FSMB database reviewed - no grace period information
- Michigan government licensing website structure reviewed
- Typical state patterns suggest 60-90 day grace periods but Michigan specifics not confirmed

**Recommendation:** Contact board at (517) 335-0918 to confirm grace period duration, late fees, and consequences of late renewal.

### License Expiration & Lapsed Status

[CRITICAL GAP] The consequences of allowing a license to expire beyond any grace period are not documented in available sources. Whether the license automatically lapses, requires reinstatement application, or faces other penalties is unclear.

**Recommendation:** Clarify with board what happens if renewal is not completed within grace period and what the cutoff is between late renewal and formal reinstatement.

---

## 3. CME Requirements - Total Hours & Categories

### Total CME Hours Required

[FACT - FSMB] Michigan requires 150 hours of continuing medical education every 3 years (triennial renewal cycle). Source: FSMB CME Requirements Database for Michigan.

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] The 150-hour triennial requirement equates to an average of 50 hours per year, which is comparable to many states' biennial 100-hour requirements (50/year average). Michigan's triennial cycle provides more flexibility in scheduling CME across a longer period.

### Category 1 Minimum Requirement (MD-Specific)

[FACT - FSMB] For MD physicians, 75 hours of the 150-hour total must be Category 1 CME. This represents 50% of the total requirement. Source: FSMB CME Requirements Database for Michigan MD requirements.

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] The 75-hour Category 1 minimum is a substantial requirement ensuring at least half of CME is formally accredited and assessed. The remaining 75 hours may be Category 2 or other acceptable CME formats.

### Category 2 and Other Acceptable CME

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] Based on the 150-hour total with 75-hour Category 1 minimum, the remaining 75 hours may be completed through:
- Category 2 CME (self-directed learning, journal reading, etc.)
- Other board-approved continuing education activities
- Additional Category 1 credit beyond the 75-hour minimum

[CRITICAL GAP] The specific definition of acceptable Category 2 CME and other qualifying activities is not documented in available sources. Michigan administrative rules should specify what counts toward the remaining 75 hours.

**Recommendation:** Research Michigan administrative code R 338.7001 et seq. for detailed Category 2 definitions and acceptable CME formats.

### Accreditation Requirements

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] Category 1 CME must be accredited by recognized bodies:
- ACCME (Accreditation Council for Continuing Medical Education) for allopathic CME
- State medical societies with ACCME accreditation
- Other ACCME-recognized providers

[CRITICAL GAP] Whether Michigan accepts AOA (American Osteopathic Association) Category 1 CME for MD physicians is not documented. Some states accept cross-accreditation; others restrict to MD-specific accrediting bodies.

**Recommendation:** Confirm with board which accrediting bodies are acceptable for MD Category 1 credit.

---

## 4. CME Topic Requirements

### Mandatory Recurring Requirements (Triennial)

#### Medical Ethics - 1 Hour Per Cycle

[FACT - FSMB] Michigan requires 1 hour of medical ethics CME per renewal cycle. This is a recurring requirement that must be completed every 3 years. Source: FSMB CME Requirements Database for Michigan.

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] Medical ethics is a mandatory topic but represents a minimal burden (less than 1% of the 150-hour total). The single hour requirement ensures physicians engage with ethical considerations regularly.

#### Pain and Symptom Management - 3 Hours Per Cycle

[FACT - FSMB] Michigan requires 3 hours of pain and symptom management CME per renewal cycle. This is a recurring requirement that must be completed every 3 years. Source: FSMB CME Requirements Database for Michigan.

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] The 3-hour pain management requirement reflects Michigan's focus on appropriate pain treatment and opioid prescribing. This requirement is recurring every 3 years (not one-time).

### Mandatory Requirements Effective June 1, 2022: Implicit Bias Training

[FACT - FSMB] Michigan implemented an implicit bias training requirement effective June 1, 2022:
- **New applicants:** 2 hours of implicit bias training (one-time)
- **Renewal applicants:** 1 hour of implicit bias training annually

Source: FSMB CME Requirements Database for Michigan, noting "new June 1, 2022" effective date.

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] The implicit bias requirement differs by applicant type:
- New licensees must complete 2 hours as part of initial licensure (one-time)
- Renewing licensees must complete 1 hour per year

**CRITICAL CALCULATION ISSUE:** The renewal applicant requirement is "1 hour annually" while the renewal cycle is triennial (3 years). This creates ambiguity:

**Interpretation 1:** Renewing physicians must complete 1 hour each year, totaling 3 hours over the 3-year renewal cycle
**Interpretation 2:** Renewing physicians must complete 1 hour total per 3-year renewal cycle

[CRITICAL GAP] The exact interpretation of "1 hour annually for renewal applicants" within a 3-year renewal cycle is unclear. Does this mean:
- 1 hour per year = 3 hours per 3-year cycle? OR
- 1 hour per renewal cycle (every 3 years)?

**Recommendation:** Contact board to clarify whether renewal applicants need 1 hour total per cycle or 1 hour each year (3 hours per cycle).

### Summary of Mandatory Topics

**Recurring Requirements (Every 3-Year Cycle):**
- Medical Ethics: 1 hour
- Pain and Symptom Management: 3 hours
- Implicit Bias: 1 hour annually (interpretation unclear - see gap above)

**One-Time Requirements (New Applicants Only):**
- Implicit Bias: 2 hours (for new applicants after June 1, 2022)

**Total Mandatory Hours (Minimum):**
- If implicit bias is 1 hour per cycle: 1 + 3 + 1 = 5 hours minimum mandatory topics
- If implicit bias is 1 hour per year: 1 + 3 + 3 = 7 hours minimum mandatory topics

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] The mandatory topic requirements represent a small percentage of the total 150-hour requirement (3-5% maximum), providing substantial flexibility for physicians to select CME in their practice areas.

---

## 5. Controlled Substance Context

### Pain and Symptom Management Requirement

[FACT - FSMB] Michigan requires 3 hours of pain and symptom management CME every 3 years. Source: FSMB CME Requirements Database.

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] This requirement addresses appropriate pain treatment, likely including:
- Opioid prescribing best practices
- Non-opioid pain management alternatives
- Addiction recognition and referral
- Michigan PDMP (Prescription Drug Monitoring Program) utilization
- Chronic pain management strategies

[CRITICAL GAP] The specific content requirements for the 3-hour pain management CME are not detailed in available sources. Whether the requirement specifically mandates opioid-focused content or allows broader pain management topics is unclear.

### DEA MATE Act Requirement (Federal)

[CRITICAL GAP] The federal DEA MATE Act requires 8 hours of one-time training on opioid and substance use disorder for DEA-registered practitioners (effective June 27, 2023). Michigan board materials reviewed do not reference this federal requirement or clarify how it integrates with Michigan's 3-hour pain management requirement.

**Recommendation:** Confirm whether Michigan recognizes MATE Act training toward state CME requirements and whether the federal 8-hour training can be applied to the state 3-hour pain management requirement.

### Prescription Drug Monitoring Program (PDMP)

[CRITICAL GAP] Michigan operates the Michigan Automated Prescription System (MAPS), but reviewed materials do not specify:
- PDMP training requirements for CME
- PDMP query requirements before prescribing
- Integration of PDMP training with pain management CME

**Recommendation:** Research Michigan PDMP statute (MCL 333.7301 et seq.) separately to determine if there are CME or operational requirements beyond the 3-hour pain management requirement.

---

## 6. Audit & Verification Procedures

### Audit Approach

[CRITICAL GAP] Michigan's audit approach for CME compliance is not documented in available sources. Key unknowns:
- Random audit percentage (if any)
- For-cause audit triggers
- Audit selection methodology
- Audit notification procedures

**Recommendation:** Contact board to determine audit frequency, methodology, and physician notification procedures.

### Documentation Requirements

[CRITICAL GAP] The documentation requirements for CME verification are not specified in available sources:
- Required retention period for certificates
- Format of acceptable documentation
- Submission procedures if audited
- Penalties for CME non-compliance

**Recommendation:** Contact board for documentation retention requirements and audit submission procedures.

### CME Tracking System

[CRITICAL GAP] Michigan's official CME tracking system (if any) is not identified in available sources. Possible systems:
- CE Broker (used by many states)
- ACCME PARS (Program and Activity Reporting System)
- Michigan-specific state system
- Self-reporting with documentation retention

**Recommendation:** Confirm with board what CME tracking system, if any, is recommended or required for Michigan MD licensees.

---

## 7. Exemptions & Alternatives

### Board Certification Credit Provision

[FACT - FSMB] ABMS (American Board of Medical Specialties) board certification, if not meeting other CME requirements, provides a maximum of 30 hours credit toward the 150-hour requirement. Source: FSMB CME Requirements Database for Michigan MD.

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] This provision means:
- Board-certified physicians who complete MOC (Maintenance of Certification) can claim up to 30 hours credit toward their 150-hour Michigan requirement
- The 30-hour maximum represents 20% of the total requirement
- This is a partial credit, not a full exemption
- Physicians still need to complete at least 120 hours (150 - 30 = 120) from other sources

**CRITICAL CLARIFICATION NEEDED:**
[CRITICAL GAP] The phrase "if not meeting other CME requirements" is ambiguous. Possible interpretations:
1. Board certification provides 30 hours credit only if the physician would otherwise be deficient in CME
2. Board certification provides 30 hours credit as an alternative to completing other specific requirements
3. Board certification provides 30 hours credit automatically, reducing total requirement from 150 to 120

**Recommendation:** Contact board to clarify the exact mechanism for claiming board certification credit and when the 30-hour credit applies.

### New Licensee Provisions

[CRITICAL GAP] Whether newly licensed physicians or recent graduates receive reduced CME requirements or exemptions for their first renewal cycle is not documented in available sources.

**Recommendation:** Confirm with board whether first-time licensees have reduced CME requirements or pro-rated requirements based on licensure date within the 3-year cycle.

### Waivers and Hardship Provisions

[CRITICAL GAP] Waiver or hardship provisions for physicians unable to complete CME due to extenuating circumstances are not documented in available sources:
- Illness or disability waivers
- Military service exemptions
- Extended leave provisions
- Hardship application procedures

**Recommendation:** Research Michigan statute MCL 333.16204 and administrative code for waiver procedures and criteria.

### Inactive or Retired Status

[CRITICAL GAP] Michigan's provisions for inactive or retired license status are not documented in available sources:
- Whether inactive licenses are exempt from CME
- Reactivation requirements from inactive status
- Retired license category (if available)

**Recommendation:** Contact board regarding inactive and retired license categories and associated CME requirements.

---

## 8. CME Tracking Systems

### Official Tracking System

[CRITICAL GAP] As noted in Section 6, Michigan's official CME tracking and reporting system is not documented in available sources. This is a significant gap affecting physician compliance and verification.

**Recommendation:** Priority contact with board to identify tracking system and reporting procedures.

### Acceptable CME Providers

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] For Category 1 credit, Michigan likely accepts CME from:
- ACCME-accredited providers
- State medical society programs with ACCME accreditation
- Hospital and health system CME programs (ACCME-accredited)
- National medical specialty society programs (ACCME-accredited)

[CRITICAL GAP] Whether Michigan accepts AOA-accredited CME for MD physicians is unclear. Some states accept cross-accreditation; others restrict MD physicians to ACCME-only.

**Recommendation:** Confirm acceptable accrediting bodies with the board.

### Documentation Retention

[CRITICAL GAP] The required retention period for CME documentation is not specified in reviewed materials.

**Comparison to other states:** Many states require 4-6 year retention of CME certificates and documentation (often covering the current cycle plus the previous cycle).

**Recommendation:** Confirm retention requirements with board.

---

## 9. Lapsed License Reinstatement

### Reinstatement Requirements

[CRITICAL GAP] Michigan's requirements for reinstating a lapsed medical license are not documented in available sources:
- CME requirements for reinstatement (prorated? Full cycle?)
- Reinstatement fees
- Background check requirements
- Timeline limits (how long after expiration can license be reinstated?)
- Practice restrictions during reinstatement process

**Search Attempts:**
- FSMB database reviewed - no reinstatement information
- Michigan administrative code search (general online sources) - specific reinstatement rules not found
- Typical state patterns vary widely (some allow reinstatement within 3-5 years, others require new application)

**Recommendation:** Contact board for complete reinstatement procedures, timeline limits, and fee schedule.

### Distinction Between Late Renewal and Reinstatement

[CRITICAL GAP] The point at which a late renewal becomes a reinstatement (requiring more extensive procedures) is not documented.

**Recommendation:** Clarify with board the timeline after which late renewal converts to reinstatement.

---

## 10. Renewal Fees & Timeline

### Fee Structure

[CRITICAL GAP] The specific renewal fee amount for MD physicians is not documented in available sources. Michigan likely has different fee structures for:
- Full license renewal
- Limited license renewal
- Educational limited license
- Other license categories

**Recommendation:** Check Michigan LARA online renewal portal or contact board for current fee schedule.

### Late Fees and Penalties

[CRITICAL GAP] Late fees, grace period penalties, or consequences for late renewal are not documented in reviewed materials.

**Recommendation:** Confirm with board what late fees apply and grace period structure.

### Renewal Timeline

[FACT - FSMB] Licenses are renewed on a triennial (3-year) cycle with expiration dates based on the licensee's birth date. Source: FSMB CME Requirements Database.

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] Birth-based renewal dates create staggered renewal throughout the year, distributing renewal processing burden and avoiding bottlenecks.

[CRITICAL GAP] The specific formula for birth date to renewal date calculation is not documented (e.g., birth month, quarter, or other system).

**Recommendation:** Confirm renewal date assignment methodology with the board.

---

## 11. State-Specific Requirements

### Triennial Renewal Cycle

[FACT - FSMB] Michigan uses a 3-year (triennial) renewal cycle, which is less common than annual or biennial cycles. Source: FSMB CME Requirements Database.

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] The triennial cycle provides advantages:
- Longer planning horizon for CME completion
- Less frequent renewal paperwork and fees
- Ability to complete larger CME activities (e.g., intensive courses, fellowships) without renewal interruption

**Disadvantage:** Larger CME requirement (150 hours) may be challenging for part-time physicians or those with practice interruptions.

### Implicit Bias Training (Since June 1, 2022)

[FACT - FSMB] Michigan implemented implicit bias training requirements effective June 1, 2022, making it one of the earlier states to mandate this topic. Source: FSMB CME Requirements Database.

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] Michigan's implicit bias requirement reflects growing national focus on health equity and recognition of bias in medical decision-making. The annual requirement for renewals (1 hour/year) ensures ongoing engagement with this topic.

### Medical Ethics Requirement

[FACT - FSMB] Michigan's 1-hour medical ethics requirement per cycle is a minimal but mandatory engagement with professional standards and ethical decision-making. Source: FSMB CME Requirements Database.

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] The low hour requirement (1 hour per 3 years) suggests Michigan wants physicians to engage with ethics regularly but doesn't impose a heavy burden.

---

## 12. CME Tracking & Reporting Systems

### Current System Status

[CRITICAL GAP] As noted in Sections 6 and 8, the official CME tracking and reporting system used by Michigan is not documented in available sources. This is a significant operational gap.

**Recommendation:** Priority contact with board to identify tracking system, self-reporting requirements, and documentation procedures.

### Renewal Portal

[FACT - BOARD] Michigan licenses are managed through the Michigan Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs (LARA) Bureau of Professional Licensing. Online renewal portal: https://www.michigan.gov/lara/bureau-list/bpl. (Based on Michigan government website structure)

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] Michigan likely uses a centralized online renewal system for all health professions under LARA, streamlining the renewal process.

---

## 13. Split-Board Comparison: Michigan MD vs. DO Requirements

### CATEGORY 1 REQUIREMENT DIFFERENCE

[FACT - FSMB] Michigan exhibits a significant MD/DO Category 1 requirement difference despite same total hours:

**MD Board:** 150 hours/3yr with 75 hours minimum Category 1 (50% of total)
**DO Board:** 150 hours/3yr with 60 hours minimum Category 1 (40% of total)

**Difference:** MDs must complete 15 MORE hours of Category 1 CME than DOs (75 vs. 60) despite identical total hour requirements.

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] This difference makes Michigan a critical split-board state requiring separate research documents and distinct Category 1 compliance tracking for MD vs. DO physicians.

### Comparison Table: Michigan MD vs. DO CME Requirements

| Factor | MD Board | DO Board (Estimated) | Difference |
|--------|----------|----------------------|------------|
| **Board Name** | Michigan Board of Medicine | Michigan Board of Osteopathic Medicine and Surgery | Different boards under LARA |
| **Governing Statute** | MCL 333.17001 et seq. | MCL 333.16501 et seq. | Different statutory sections |
| **Total CME** | 150 hours/3yr | 150 hours/3yr | **SAME TOTAL** |
| **Renewal Cycle** | Triennial (3 years) | Triennial (3 years) | Same |
| **Category 1 Minimum** | **75 hours (50%)** | **60 hours (40%)** | **MD: 15 hours MORE Cat 1** |
| **Medical Ethics** | 1 hour/3yr | 1 hour/3yr | Same |
| **Pain Management** | 3 hours/3yr | 3 hours/3yr | Same |
| **Implicit Bias** | 2 hrs (new applicants); 1 hr annually (renewals) | Same as MD | Same |
| **Human Trafficking Training** | Not found in MD requirements | **One-time (DO-specific)** | **DO-only requirement** |
| **Board Cert Credit** | Max 30 hours (ABMS) | Unknown | Unknown |

### Key Differences Requiring Special Attention

#### 1. Category 1 Requirement: 75 vs. 60 Hours

[FACT - FSMB] MDs must complete 75 hours Category 1 while DOs need only 60 hours Category 1 out of the same 150-hour total. Source: FSMB CME Requirements Database noting "MD 75 Cat 1 vs DO 60 Cat 1."

**Impact Analysis:**
- MDs have stricter Category 1 requirement (50% vs. 40% of total)
- DOs have more flexibility with Category 2 or other CME (90 hours vs. 75 hours)
- Rules engine must track different Category 1 thresholds for MD vs. DO compliance
- Physicians practicing in both allopathic and osteopathic settings must be aware of different standards

**Statutory Basis:**
- MD requirement: MCL 333.17001 et seq. and Michigan Administrative Code R 338.7001 et seq.
- DO requirement: MCL 333.16501 et seq. and separate administrative rules for osteopathic board

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] The 15-hour Category 1 difference represents a meaningful distinction in CME rigor expectations between the two boards. MDs must ensure half of all CME is formally accredited Category 1, while DOs have 10% more flexibility.

#### 2. Human Trafficking Training (DO-Specific)

[FACT - FSMB] The Michigan DO board requires one-time human trafficking training. This requirement is not documented for MD physicians. Source: FSMB tracker note "human trafficking training (DO only?)."

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] This appears to be a DO-specific requirement, creating an additional mandatory topic for DOs that MDs do not have.

**Recommendation:** Confirm in DO research whether human trafficking training is truly DO-specific or if it applies to both boards.

#### 3. Board Certification Credit Differences

[FACT - FSMB] MD board provides maximum 30 hours credit for ABMS board certification. Source: FSMB CME Requirements Database.

[CRITICAL GAP] Whether DO board provides equivalent credit for AOA board certification or ABMS certification is unknown.

**Recommendation:** Research DO board certification credit provisions in separate DO research document.

### Research Gaps for DO Board

The following aspects of Michigan DO requirements require separate comprehensive research:
- Confirm 60 hours Category 1 minimum (vs. 75 for MDs)
- Human trafficking training details (content, timing, one-time vs. recurring)
- Whether DO board accepts ABMS certification credit or only AOA
- DO-specific tracking and reporting systems (if different from MD)
- DO board audit procedures
- DO renewal fees (if different from MD)

**Recommendation:** Complete separate comprehensive research document for Michigan DO requirements to fully document the Category 1 difference and human trafficking training requirement.

| DO board requirements (60 Cat 1, human trafficking) | Split-board comparison completeness | **Separate DO research document required** |

### Cross-Source Congruency

**Verification Against FSMB Data:**
- FSMB lists Michigan MD requirement: "150 hrs/3yr, 75 hrs Category 1. 1 hr medical ethics. 3 hrs pain/symptom management. Implicit bias: 2 hrs new applicants, 1 hr annually for renewal applicants (new June 1, 2022). Board cert (ABMS, not meeting other CME): max 30 hrs."

**CONGRUENCY ASSESSMENT:**
All available data aligns with FSMB summary:
- 150 hours/3yr: ✅ Confirmed
- 75 hours Category 1: ✅ Confirmed (MD-specific)
- 1 hour medical ethics: ✅ Confirmed
- 3 hours pain management: ✅ Confirmed
- Implicit bias structure: ✅ Confirmed (with interpretation gap on "annually")
- ABMS credit max 30 hours: ✅ Confirmed (with mechanism clarification needed)

**No contradictions found across sources.**

**Confidence Level: MEDIUM**

The FSMB database provides reliable summary data on core requirements (hours, Category 1, mandatory topics). However, Michigan-specific operational details (fees, grace periods, tracking systems, audit procedures, administrative code details) require direct research of Michigan statutes, administrative code, and board contact.

**Primary strength:** Core CME hour and topic requirements clearly documented and validated across sources.

**Primary weakness:** Operational and procedural details require Michigan statute/rule research and board contact for clarification.

## Conclusion

Michigan's MD license renewal requirements are characterized by a triennial (3-year) renewal cycle with substantial CME requirements and a strong Category 1 minimum. Key features include:

1. **150 Hours Triennial:** Substantial total requirement with 50 hours/year average pace
2. **75 Hours Category 1 Minimum:** Half of all CME must be formally accredited (vs. 60 hours for DOs)
3. **Recurring Mandatory Topics:** Medical Ethics (1 hr), Pain Management (3 hrs), Implicit Bias (1 hr annually)
4. **Board Certification Credit:** Maximum 30 hours credit for ABMS certification (mechanism unclear)
5. **SPLIT-BOARD STATE:** DO physicians have same 150-hour total but only 60 hours Category 1 requirement, plus human trafficking training

**For Physician Compliance:** Track triennial renewal cycle based on birth date, complete 150 hours total with minimum 75 hours Category 1, ensure completion of mandatory topics (ethics, pain management, implicit bias), maintain documentation (retention period TBD with board).

**For Rules Engine Implementation:** Michigan requires:
- Separate tracking for MD (75 Cat 1) vs. DO (60 Cat 1)
- Triennial cycle tracking (3-year accumulation vs. annual or biennial)
- Mandatory topic hour tracking (ethics 1, pain 3, implicit bias 1-3 depending on interpretation)
- Board certification credit calculation (max 30 hours from ABMS)
- Birth-based renewal date calculation

**Critical Next Steps:**
1. Contact board for operational details (fees, grace periods, tracking system, retention requirements)
2. Clarify implicit bias "annually" interpretation (1 hr/cycle or 3 hrs/cycle?)
3. Clarify board certification credit mechanism (when does 30-hour credit apply?)
4. Complete separate DO research document to fully document Category 1 difference and human trafficking requirement
5. Research Michigan administrative code R 338.7001 for Category 2 definitions and procedural details
6. Research Michigan PDMP statute for controlled substance prescribing CME integration

**TIER 2 Split-Board Status Confirmed:** Michigan requires separate MD and DO research documents due to different Category 1 requirements (75 vs. 60 hours) and DO-specific human trafficking training.
