## BOARD INFORMATION & AUTHORITY

### Board Structure and Designation

[FACT - STATUTE] The Colorado Medical Board is established under C.R.S. § 12-240 (Medical Practice Act) and operates under the Department of Regulatory Agencies (DORA), Division of Professions and Occupations.

[FACT - BOARD] Board website: https://dora.colorado.gov/boards-commissions/medical
[FACT - BOARD] Board contact phone: 303-894-7800
[FACT - BOARD] Board contact email: dora_dpo_licensing@state.co.us

### Board Authority for CME

[FACT - STATUTE] The primary authority for CME requirements is established under C.R.S. § 12-240-130.5, which was enacted through House Bill 24-1153 and signed into law on August 6, 2024 per [FACT - BOARD] Children's Hospital Colorado CE documentation.

[FACT - STATUTE] Per C.R.S. § 12-240-130.5, the statute mandates: "A physician shall comply with continuing medical education (CME) requirements established by the board by rule to demonstrate that the physician continues to remain knowledgeable about topics in the physician's area of practice and maintain competency."

### Rulemaking Timeline

[FACT - BOARD] The Colorado Medical Board is in the process of developing implementing rules with the following timeline:
- March 24, 2025: Early engagement stakeholder meeting
- June/July 2025: Second stakeholder meeting
- August 28, 2025: Public rulemaking hearing and rule adoption
- October 30, 2025: Rules become effective

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] The rulemaking process indicates final rule details may differ from current statute language. Rules are expected to clarify specifics on CME provider accreditation, proof documentation requirements, and exemption procedures.

---

## LIFECYCLE PHASES & GRACE PERIODS

### License Renewal Cycle

[FACT - STATUTE] Per C.R.S. § 12-240-130.5 and FSMB documentation, all physician licenses expire on **April 30 of odd-numbered years**.

[FACT - STATUTE] The renewal cycle is **24 months**, meaning physicians must complete CME requirements during the 24-month period immediately preceding license renewal or reactivation.

### Grace Period for Newly Licensed Physicians

[CRITICAL GAP] No specific grace period for newly licensed physicians was identified in statute or board documentation. The statute references CME requirements "preceding renewal, reinstatement, or reactivation" but does not specify exemptions for newly licensed physicians within the first licensing cycle.

**Search Attempts:** Searched statute text (C.R.S. § 12-240-130.5), board FAQ, and HB24-1153 documentation. Grace period provisions may be addressed in board rules (expected October 30, 2025).

### Reactivation and Reinstatement

[FACT - STATUTE] Per 3 CCR 713-1.8 and C.R.S. § 12-240-130.5, physicians seeking to reactivate an inactive license or reinstate an expired license must comply with CME requirements documented during the relevant 24-month period.

[FACT - STATUTE] Physicians not engaged in active practice for one year prior to reinstatement/reactivation must demonstrate "continued competency" per 3 CCR 713-1.8.

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] CME is a core component of demonstrating continued competency; physicians reinstating after extended absence would need to satisfy the full 24-month CME requirement relevant to their reinstatement date.

---

## CME REQUIREMENTS - TOTAL HOURS & CATEGORIES

### Required CME Hours

[FACT - STATUTE] Effective with the **2027 renewal cycle**, physicians must complete **30 credit hours of CME** in the 24 months preceding renewal, reinstatement, or reactivation per C.R.S. § 12-240-130.5.

[FACT - BOARD] Per Colorado Medical Board documentation, beginning January 1, 2026, the board will audit up to 5% of renewals annually to verify compliance with CME requirements.

### CME Categories and Flexibility

[FACT - STATUTE] Per C.R.S. § 12-240-130.5: "A physician must complete thirty credit hours of CME in topics selected by the physician and also in topics specified in the act."

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] This language indicates most of the 30 hours are physician-selected, with a portion reserved for mandatory topics (opioid/substance use disorder training—see below). No specific category restrictions (Category 1 vs. 2, etc.) are explicitly stated in statute language reviewed.

[FACT - STATUTE] Per HB24-1153 statute and Colorado Medical Society documentation, acceptable CME includes:
- Programs accredited by Colorado Medical Society
- AMA-accredited programs (qualifying for AMA PRA Category 1 credit)
- Programs accredited by ACCME
- AAFP-prescribed credit programs
- ACOG-approved programs
- Programs required to maintain national board certification (ABMS, ABOS, etc.)

### Carryover Provisions

[CRITICAL GAP] No carryover language is documented in available statute or board materials. It is unclear whether physicians can carry over excess CME hours from one cycle to the next.

**Search Attempts:** Searched HB24-1153 text, C.R.S. § 12-240-130.5, and board FAQ pages. Carryover provisions may be addressed in board rulemaking (expected completion October 30, 2025).

---

## CME TOPIC REQUIREMENTS

### Mandatory Opioid/Substance Use Disorder Training

[FACT - STATUTE] Per C.R.S. § 12-240-130.5: Physicians must complete **2 hours per renewal cycle** on topics relating to "the treatment and management of patients with opioid use disorder and other substance use disorders."

[FACT - STATUTE] Acceptable opioid/substance use disorder CME topics include:
- Acute or chronic pain management
- Appropriate prescribing of opioids
- Recognition of substance use disorders
- Referral of patients with substance use disorders for treatment
- Use of the Electronic Prescription Drug Monitoring Program (PDMP)

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] These 2 hours are counted within the 30-hour total requirement, not in addition to it.

### Pending Topic Requirements

[FACT - BOARD] The statute directs the board to "initiate a stakeholder process for the board to consider requiring specific credit hours relating to:
- Health disparities and outcomes data
- Reproductive, sexual, and gender-based health care
- Explicit and implicit bias"

[CRITICAL GAP] These potential topics are under board consideration but have not yet been finalized. Rules are expected October 30, 2025, which will clarify whether any of these become mandatory and if so, how many hours required.

**Impact:** Rules released in October 2025 may add additional mandatory topic requirements to the 30-hour base, affecting renewals starting in the 2027 cycle.

---

## CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE CONTEXT

### DEA Registration and Additional Requirements

[FACT - STATUTE] The base CME requirement (2 hours opioid/substance use disorder) applies to all physicians, not solely those with DEA registration.

[CRITICAL GAP] Colorado statute does not explicitly address whether additional CME is required solely for DEA-registered physicians. However, the 2-hour opioid/substance use disorder requirement appears to be a universal mandate.

### Federal DEA Requirements vs. State

[FACT - BOARD] Physicians with current DEA registration are subject to federal DEA CME requirements, which are separate from Colorado state requirements.

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] Federal CME requirements for DEA registrants (8 hours one-time opioid treatment management training per 21 CFR Part 1301) are distinct from Colorado's 2-hour per cycle state requirement and would not satisfy each other.

### PDMP (Prescription Drug Monitoring Program) Training

[FACT - STATUTE] Use of the Electronic Prescription Drug Monitoring Program (PDMP) is explicitly listed as an acceptable topic for the mandatory 2-hour opioid/substance use disorder requirement.

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] PDMP training can fulfill the 2-hour opioid/substance use disorder mandate if structured as CME credit.

### Prescribing Limits and Documentation

[CRITICAL GAP] Colorado statute reviewed does not establish explicit prescribing quantity limits or prescribing documentation requirements in the context of CME or licensure. These may be addressed in state rules or board disciplinary policies outside the scope of CME requirements.

---

## AUDIT & VERIFICATION PROCEDURES

### Audit Authorization and Scope

[FACT - STATUTE] Per C.R.S. § 12-240-130.5: "The board is authorized to audit up to five percent of physician renewals annually to verify compliance with the CME requirement."

[FACT - STATUTE] The statute specifies the audit approach: "chosen at random with an oversampling of nonboard-certified physicians."

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] Non-board-certified physicians are more likely to be audited than board-certified physicians, indicating the board places slightly more trust in board-certified physicians' MOC activities to satisfy CME requirements.

### Audit Timeline

[FACT - BOARD] CME compliance audits will begin on January 1, 2026, even though the CME requirement does not take effect until the 2027 renewal cycle. This indicates the board will conduct test audits during the transition period.

### Proof of CME Completion

[FACT - STATUTE] Per C.R.S. § 12-240-130.5: When audited, physicians "shall submit proof of the CME programs completed and the CME credit hours awarded."

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] Required documentation includes:
- CME certificates or transcripts from providers
- Proof of credit hours awarded
- Program descriptions showing alignment with CME standards

[CRITICAL GAP] Specific documentation retention periods (e.g., physicians must retain records for X years) are not documented in statute. Rules expected October 30, 2025 will likely clarify documentation and retention requirements.

### Compliance Verification Method

[FACT - STATUTE] Per C.R.S. § 12-240-130.5: "Physicians shall affirm on the license renewal form submitted to the board that the physician has complied with the CME requirement."

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] Initial verification is attestation-based (self-report) rather than automatic provider reporting. This suggests physicians are responsible for gathering and maintaining CME documentation, though board may verify via audit.

### Penalties for Non-Compliance

[FACT - STATUTE] Per C.R.S. § 12-240-130.5: "A physician's failure to comply with the CME requirement or to submit proof to the board during a board audit, without reasonable cause, constitutes unprofessional conduct."

[FACT - STATUTE] Consequences: "If a physician fails to comply with the CME requirement, the physician's license is inactive until reinstated by the board."

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] Non-compliance progression:
1. Initial failure to submit CME on renewal form
2. Audit triggered by board
3. Failure to submit proof during audit (without reasonable cause) = unprofessional conduct
4. License automatically becomes inactive
5. Reinstatement process required to restore active status

---

## EXEMPTIONS & ALTERNATIVES

### Board Certification and Maintenance of Certification (MOC)

[FACT - STATUTE] Per C.R.S. § 12-240-130.5, CME requirements include "programs required in order to maintain national board certification, not including a program of self-study or a program self-claimed or self-documented."

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] Physicians maintaining ABMS, ABOS, or other national board certification may count CME activities required for MOC toward Colorado's 30-hour requirement. This includes:
- Board certification exam preparation
- MOC examinations and assessments
- CME activities specifically required by the board
- Practice improvement activities recognized by the board

[CRITICAL GAP] Whether ABMS/ABOS board certification **exempts** a physician from the 30-hour requirement entirely (i.e., full exemption) is not explicitly stated in statute. Current language suggests MOC activities count toward but may not fully replace the 30-hour requirement.

**Research Note:** Many other states provide full CME exemption for board-certified physicians during certification maintenance period. Colorado's statute language is less clear and may require board rulemaking (expected October 2025) to clarify.

### Resident and Fellow Physicians

[CRITICAL GAP] No exemptions or modified requirements for resident physicians, fellow physicians, or physicians in training are documented in statute or board materials reviewed.

**Search Attempts:** Searched HB24-1153, C.R.S. § 12-240-130.5, and board FAQ. May be addressed in October 2025 rules.

### Medical Student Teachers/Preceptors

[CRITICAL GAP] While one source referenced up to 20 hours of medical student teaching/preceptorship may qualify toward CME in reinstatement contexts, the statute does not explicitly address whether such activities count toward the mandatory 30-hour requirement for routine renewals.

### Hardship or Medical Exemptions

[CRITICAL GAP] No explicit hardship, medical, or other exemptions are documented in statute reviewed. Rules expected October 2025 may address emergency exemptions or hardship waivers.

### Noncompliant and Compliant Physician Paths

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] Based on statute language and board audit procedures, exemptions appear minimal. The board's rulemaking process (expected completion October 30, 2025) will likely clarify any exemptions available.

---

## RENEWAL FEES & TIMELINE

### License Renewal Schedule

[FACT - STATUTE] All physician licenses expire **April 30 of odd-numbered years** per C.R.S. § 12-240-119.

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] Renewal occurs on a **2-year cycle** (biennial renewal).

### Renewal Fee Structure

[CRITICAL GAP] Specific renewal fee amounts are not documented in statute or board materials reviewed. However, C.R.S. § 12-240-130.5 specifies that licensure renewal fees will increase to cover administrative costs associated with CME requirement implementation.

[FACT - STATUTE] Per HB24-1153: "The general assembly shall appropriate money to the department for the implementation of this section, and the board may increase the physician licensure renewal fee."

**Research Note:** Specific fee amounts will likely be published on the Colorado DPO website or announced in board rulemaking (expected October 2025).

### Late Renewal and Penalties

[CRITICAL GAP] Late renewal fees and penalties are not documented in statute reviewed. Standard administrative rules may apply but were not located in CME-specific regulations.

### Grace Period for Renewal Submission

[CRITICAL GAP] No statutory grace period is documented for submitting renewals after the April 30 expiration date. Standard administrative rules likely apply but were not located.

---

## LAPSED LICENSE REINSTATEMENT

### Reinstatement Process Overview

[FACT - STATUTE] Per 3 CCR 713-1.8 and C.R.S. § 12-240-130, physicians with expired (lapsed) licenses must file a formal Reinstatement Application with the board.

[FACT - BOARD] Reinstatement requirements include:
- Completed reinstatement application
- Applicable reinstatement fee
- Verification from states where currently licensed (if any)
- Verification of last two years work history
- FSMB Databank verification
- Proof of malpractice insurance compliance (or exemption claim)
- Demonstration of continued competency (if lapsed >1 year)

### CME Requirements for Reinstatement

[FACT - STATUTE] Per C.R.S. § 12-240-130.5, physicians reinstating a license must comply with CME requirements "documented during the relevant 24-month period preceding the date of reinstatement."

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] CME calculation for reinstatement:
- **Lapsed <1 year:** CME measured from license expiration date back 24 months
- **Lapsed >1 year:** CME still required, potentially calculated from time of relicensure back 24 months; additionally, continued competency demonstration required per 3 CCR 713-1.8

[CRITICAL GAP] Specific CME makeup requirements (e.g., whether lapsed physicians must complete full 30 hours or can use previously earned hours) are not documented. Board rulemaking (expected October 2025) will clarify this.

### Reactivation vs. Reinstatement

[FACT - STATUTE] Per 3 CCR 713-1.8, Colorado distinguishes between:
- **Reinstatement:** Changes license status from Expired to Active (used when license completely expired)
- **Reactivation:** Changes license status from Inactive to Active (used when physician voluntarily placed license on inactive status)

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] Both reinstatement and reactivation require CME compliance as of the effective date of status change.

---

## CME TRACKING SYSTEMS

### Self-Reporting and Attestation

[FACT - STATUTE] Per C.R.S. § 12-240-130.5: "Physicians shall affirm on the license renewal form submitted to the board that the physician has complied with the CME requirement."

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] Colorado uses a **self-reporting/attestation model** rather than mandatory provider reporting. Physicians are responsible for:
1. Tracking their own CME activities
2. Maintaining documentation (certificates, transcripts)
3. Affirming compliance on renewal form
4. Responding to board audits with proof if selected

### Approved CME Providers and Accreditation

[FACT - BOARD] Recognized CME accreditors in Colorado:
- **Colorado Medical Society** (state accreditor)
- **ACCME** (Accreditation Council for Continuing Medical Education)
- **AMA** (American Medical Association PRA Category 1 credit)
- **AAFP** (American Academy of Family Physicians)
- **ACOG** (American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists)
- **ABMS** and other national specialty boards (for board certification/MOC activities)

[FACT - BOARD] The Colorado Medical Society maintains a directory of CME-accredited providers. Website: https://www.cms.org/education/cme-accredited-providers/

### CE Broker and Third-Party Platforms

[FACT - BOARD] While not explicitly mandated by Colorado, CE Broker (https://cebroker.com/) is used by many providers for tracking and reporting CME compliance across multiple states. Many Colorado-accredited providers report through CE Broker.

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] CE Broker is optional but convenient for physicians who practice in multiple states or prefer centralized CME tracking.

### CME Tracking Recommendations

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] Physicians are advised to:
1. Maintain digital and/or hard copies of CME certificates
2. Track hours by date, provider, and accreditation type
3. Monitor total hours toward the 30-hour requirement
4. Document the mandatory 2-hour opioid/substance use disorder requirement separately for easy audit response

---

## STATE-SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS

### Effective Date Transition

[CRITICAL FACT] House Bill 24-1153 was signed into law on August 6, 2024, but the CME requirement is **NOT** effective until the **2027 renewal cycle**.

**Timeline:**
- August 6, 2024: HB24-1153 signed into law
- January 1, 2026: Board begins audits (trial/transition phase)
- October 30, 2025: Final implementing rules effective
- **2027 renewal cycle (April 30, 2027 expiration date onward):** CME requirement fully effective and binding

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] Physicians renewing in 2025 (for April 30, 2025 expiration) are **NOT** yet subject to the 30-hour CME requirement. CME becomes mandatory starting with renewals in 2027.

### Colorado Medical Society Role

[FACT - BOARD] The Colorado Medical Society (CMS) is the state professional association and serves as one of the official CME accreditors. The CMS website (https://www.cms.org/) provides resources for CME compliance.

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] CMS maintains CME accreditation standards aligned with ACCME and board requirements. Physicians should consult CMS for lists of approved CME providers.

### Stakeholder Engagement

[FACT - BOARD] The Colorado Medical Board is conducting stakeholder engagement sessions to develop implementing rules:
- March 24, 2025: Early engagement meeting
- June/July 2025: Second stakeholder meeting
- August 28, 2025: Public rulemaking hearing
- October 30, 2025: Rules become effective

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] Stakeholders including physicians, CME providers, and professional organizations have opportunity to comment on rule implementation. Final rules may differ from current statute language in significant ways.

## RESEARCHER NOTES

This research was conducted on January 2, 2026, during a critical transition period for Colorado CME regulations. House Bill 24-1153 represents a significant change from Colorado's previous model (no mandated CME hours) to a new model with specific hour requirements and mandatory topics.

**Key Research Challenges:**
1. Implementing rules not yet finalized (expected October 30, 2025) — some details remain uncertain
2. Effective date is future-dated (2027 cycle) — current physicians may not yet be fully informed
3. Board rulemaking process is ongoing — final details may differ from statutory language

**Recommendations for Stakeholders:**
- Monitor Colorado Medical Board website for final rule adoption (expected October 30, 2025)
- Watch for potential additional mandatory topics (health disparities, reproductive health, implicit bias)
- Prepare CME documentation systems and tracking procedures now for 2027 cycle implementation
- Subscribe to Colorado Medical Society updates for CME provider accreditation changes
