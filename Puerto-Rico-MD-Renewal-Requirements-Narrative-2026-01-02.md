## 1. Board Information & Regulatory Authority

### Official Board Information

[FACT - BOARD] The Junta Examinadora de Médicos de Puerto Rico (Puerto Rico Medical Examining Board) is the official regulatory agency for allopathic physicians in Puerto Rico.

**Board Contact Information (REQUIRES VERIFICATION):**
- Website: https://www.salud.gov.pr/Junta-Examinadora-De-Medicos
- Phone: (787) 782-8989
- Physical Address: [Contact board for current address]
- Mailing Address: [Contact board for current address]

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] As a U.S. territory, Puerto Rico operates under U.S. federal oversight but maintains autonomous medical licensing authority through the Puerto Rico Department of Health.

### Primary Statutory Framework

[REQUIRES VERIFICATION - STATUTE] Puerto Rico medical licensing is governed by Law 101 of June 24, 1965 (as amended), which establishes the Medical Practice Act for Puerto Rico.

[REQUIRES VERIFICATION - STATUTE] Continuing Medical Education requirements are established in Regulation 8620 (Reglamento 8620 - Educación Médica Continua).

[CRITICAL GAP] Specific statutory citations for each mandatory topic require verification. The following statute references are based on user-provided information and general knowledge of Puerto Rico medical regulations:
- Tropical disease CME (Dengue, Zika, Chikungunya): Regulation number TBD
- Specialty-specific requirements: Regulation number TBD
- Pain management and controlled substance CME: Regulation number TBD

### Territory-Specific Regulatory Context

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] Puerto Rico's unique status as a U.S. territory creates a regulatory framework that:
1. Operates independently from U.S. state medical boards
2. Is not included in standard FSMB state-by-state compilations in the same manner as the 50 states
3. May have language requirements (Spanish/English) for CME content
4. Reflects region-specific public health priorities (tropical diseases, chronic disease management)

[CRITICAL - REQUIRES VERIFICATION] Language requirements for CME courses (Spanish vs English) should be confirmed with the board.

---

## 2. Renewal Cycle & Dates

### Triennial Renewal Schedule (Every 3 Years)

[FACT - USER PROVIDED] Puerto Rico physicians renew their medical licenses every 36 months (triennial cycle), similar to Illinois but unlike the biennial (2-year) cycle common in many U.S. states.

[CRITICAL GAP] Specific renewal deadline dates (e.g., specific month/day every third year) were not accessible due to web tool limitations. This information must be obtained from the Puerto Rico Medical Board.

**Key Questions Requiring Board Verification:**
1. What is the specific renewal deadline date (e.g., December 31, June 30)?
2. Are renewal dates uniform for all physicians, or staggered by license number/birth month?
3. What is the submission window (e.g., 60-90 days before expiration)?
4. Are renewal reminders sent? If so, how far in advance?

### Renewal Timeline & Submission Windows

[CRITICAL GAP] Renewal submission windows, grace periods, and late renewal procedures were not accessible during research. The following should be verified:
- When can physicians begin renewal process (e.g., 90 days before expiration)?
- Is there a grace period after the expiration date?
- What are late renewal fees, if any?
- What is the cutoff for lapsed license vs. expired license requiring reinstatement?

---

## 3. CME Requirements - Base Hours & Categories

### Total CME Hours Required

[FACT - USER PROVIDED] Puerto Rico requires **60 continuing medical education hours every 36 months (triennial renewal cycle)**.

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] The 60-hour requirement is lower than Illinois (150 hrs/3yr) but comparable when annualized:
- Puerto Rico: 60 hrs / 3 years = 20 hours per year
- Illinois: 150 hrs / 3 years = 50 hours per year
- Texas: 48 hrs / 2 years = 24 hours per year

Puerto Rico's requirement is moderate in annual terms but becomes complex due to specialty and mandatory topic requirements.

### Specialty-Specific Requirement (50% of Total Hours)

[FACT - USER PROVIDED] **50% of the 60-hour CME requirement (30 hours) must be in the physician's primary specialty area.**

[CRITICAL - HIGH COMPLEXITY] This is one of the most stringent specialty-specific requirements in the United States. Most states do not mandate a specific percentage of specialty-focused CME.

**Implications:**
- Physicians must complete 30 hours in their specialty (e.g., cardiology, pediatrics, internal medicine)
- Remaining 30 hours may be general medical education or mandatory topics
- Physicians must identify their primary specialty on renewal application
- Multi-specialty or board-certified physicians may need clarification on which specialty applies

[CRITICAL GAP] The following require verification with the board:
1. How is "primary specialty" defined?
2. What documentation is required to prove specialty-specific CME?
3. How do multi-specialty physicians (e.g., internal medicine/cardiology) satisfy this requirement?
4. Can mandatory topics count toward the 30-hour specialty requirement if they are specialty-relevant (e.g., pediatric vaccines for pediatricians)?

### CME Categories & Formats

[CRITICAL GAP] The statute does not specify (or was not accessible) whether Puerto Rico accepts:
- AMA PRA Category 1 Credit only, or Category 2 as well
- AOA Category 1A/1B/2 Credit
- Informal CME (self-study, grand rounds, etc.)
- International CME (important for territory with connections to Caribbean and Latin American medical education)

[RECOMMENDATION] Contact the Puerto Rico Medical Board to clarify:
1. Acceptable CME formats (AMA Category 1, AOA, informal, etc.)
2. Whether CME must be formal (accredited) or if informal self-study counts
3. Whether Spanish-language CME is acceptable or required for certain topics
4. Whether international CME (e.g., from Caribbean or Latin American providers) counts toward requirement

---

## 4. CME Topic Requirements - Mandatory Topics (8 Total)

### Overview of Mandatory Topics

[FACT - USER PROVIDED] Puerto Rico has **EIGHT distinct mandatory CME topics**, the highest count among U.S. jurisdictions researched to date. Total mandatory hours: **minimum 15 hours** of the 60-hour requirement.

**Mandatory Topics Summary:**

| Topic | Hours | Frequency | Public Health Priority |
|-------|-------|-----------|------------------------|
| Dengue/Chikungunya/Zika | 2 hrs | Every 3 years | Tropical disease prevention (region-specific) |
| Diabetes | 1 hr | Every 3 years | Chronic disease management |
| Vaccination | 1 hr | Every 3 years | Public health/immunization |
| Obesity prevention | 1 hr | Every 3 years | Chronic disease prevention |
| Cardiovascular health | 1 hr | Every 3 years | Chronic disease management |
| Pain management | 3 hrs | Every 3 years | Controlled substance/opioid epidemic |
| Antibiotics | 3 hrs | Every 3 years | Antimicrobial resistance/stewardship |
| Bioethics/professionalism | 4 hrs | Every 3 years | Professional standards |

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] Puerto Rico's mandatory topics reflect unique public health priorities:
1. **Tropical disease focus:** Dengue, Zika, and Chikungunya are endemic or epidemic in Puerto Rico, making this CME critical for public health preparedness
2. **Chronic disease burden:** Diabetes, obesity, and cardiovascular disease have high prevalence in Puerto Rico
3. **Controlled substance focus:** Pain management and antibiotic stewardship address opioid epidemic and antimicrobial resistance

### Topic 1: Dengue/Chikungunya/Zika (2 hours, MANDATORY, Region-Specific)

[FACT - USER PROVIDED] All physicians must complete **2 hours of CME on Dengue, Chikungunya, and Zika** every 3 years.

[CRITICAL - UNIQUE REQUIREMENT] This is a **region-specific requirement unique to Puerto Rico** (and potentially the U.S. Virgin Islands and other tropical territories). No U.S. state has an equivalent tropical disease CME mandate.

**Public Health Context:**
- **Dengue fever:** Endemic in Puerto Rico with periodic epidemics
- **Chikungunya:** Emerged in Caribbean region in 2013-2014, cases in Puerto Rico
- **Zika:** Major outbreak in Puerto Rico in 2016-2017, ongoing surveillance

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] This requirement addresses:
1. Early recognition of tropical disease symptoms (fever, rash, joint pain)
2. Differential diagnosis (Dengue vs Chikungunya vs Zika vs other febrile illnesses)
3. Management and treatment protocols
4. Public health reporting requirements
5. Prevention counseling for patients

[CRITICAL GAP] The following require verification:
1. Must CME cover all three diseases (Dengue AND Chikungunya AND Zika), or is it 2 hours on tropical diseases broadly?
2. Are there approved course lists from the Puerto Rico Department of Health?
3. Can this requirement be satisfied through CDC or Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) courses?
4. Is Spanish-language CME required or acceptable for this topic?

### Topic 2: Diabetes (1 hour, MANDATORY)

[FACT - USER PROVIDED] All physicians must complete **1 hour of CME on diabetes** every 3 years.

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] Puerto Rico has high prevalence of type 2 diabetes (estimated 12-16% of adult population), making diabetes management CME a public health priority.

**Likely CME Content:**
- Diagnosis and screening guidelines
- Glycemic control and medication management
- Complication prevention (retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy, cardiovascular)
- Patient education and lifestyle modification
- Cultural competency in diabetes care for Puerto Rican population

[CRITICAL GAP] Specific content requirements, acceptable courses, and whether this applies to all specialties (including non-primary care physicians like surgeons, radiologists) require verification.

### Topic 3: Vaccination (1 hour, MANDATORY)

[FACT - USER PROVIDED] All physicians must complete **1 hour of CME on vaccination** every 3 years.

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] This requirement likely addresses:
- Adult and pediatric vaccination schedules (CDC/ACIP guidelines)
- Vaccine-preventable disease recognition
- Vaccine safety and contraindications
- Vaccination counseling and addressing vaccine hesitancy
- Special populations (immunocompromised, pregnant, elderly)

[CRITICAL GAP] Does this requirement apply to all physicians, or only those providing primary care/pediatrics? Can pediatricians satisfy this through general pediatric CME that includes vaccination content?

### Topic 4: Obesity Prevention (1 hour, MANDATORY)

[FACT - USER PROVIDED] All physicians must complete **1 hour of CME on obesity prevention** every 3 years.

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] Puerto Rico has high obesity prevalence (approximately 30-35% of adults), making this a critical public health topic.

**Likely CME Content:**
- Obesity screening and assessment (BMI, waist circumference)
- Behavioral counseling and lifestyle modification
- Pharmacologic and surgical interventions
- Childhood obesity prevention
- Cultural factors in obesity management for Puerto Rican population

[CRITICAL GAP] Is "obesity prevention" defined as prevention only, or does it include obesity management/treatment? Does it apply to all specialties?

### Topic 5: Cardiovascular Health (1 hour, MANDATORY)

[FACT - USER PROVIDED] All physicians must complete **1 hour of CME on cardiovascular health** every 3 years.

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] Cardiovascular disease is a leading cause of death in Puerto Rico, making this topic essential.

**Likely CME Content:**
- Cardiovascular risk assessment (Framingham, ASCVD scores)
- Hypertension and hyperlipidemia management
- Heart failure and coronary artery disease
- Stroke prevention
- Lifestyle modification and cardiac rehabilitation

[CRITICAL GAP] Does this requirement apply to all physicians, including non-cardiovascular specialists? Can cardiologists satisfy this through general cardiology CME?

### Topic 6: Pain Management (3 hours, MANDATORY)

[FACT - USER PROVIDED] All physicians must complete **3 hours of CME on pain management** every 3 years.

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] This requirement addresses the opioid epidemic and safe prescribing practices, similar to many U.S. states.

**Likely CME Content:**
- Acute and chronic pain assessment
- Non-opioid pain management strategies
- Safe opioid prescribing practices
- Opioid risk assessment and monitoring
- Recognition of opioid use disorder
- Alternative pain therapies (physical therapy, interventional procedures, cognitive behavioral therapy)

[CRITICAL QUESTION] Is this requirement:
1. For all physicians, or only those with DEA registration/controlled substance prescribing?
2. Separate from general pain management, or does it cover all pain topics?
3. Aligned with federal DEA MATE Act requirements (8 hours one-time for DEA registrants)?

[CRITICAL GAP] The relationship between Puerto Rico's 3-hour pain management requirement and the federal DEA MATE Act (8 hours for DEA registrants) requires clarification. Can physicians satisfy both requirements with a single 8-hour course, or are they separate?

### Topic 7: Antibiotics (3 hours, MANDATORY)

[FACT - USER PROVIDED] All physicians must complete **3 hours of CME on antibiotics** every 3 years.

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] This requirement addresses antimicrobial resistance and antibiotic stewardship, a major global public health concern.

**Likely CME Content:**
- Antimicrobial resistance patterns (local and global)
- Appropriate antibiotic selection and dosing
- Antibiotic stewardship principles
- Narrow-spectrum vs broad-spectrum antibiotic use
- Diagnostic stewardship (avoiding unnecessary testing leading to antibiotic use)
- Management of antibiotic-resistant infections (MRSA, VRE, CRE, etc.)

[CRITICAL - UNIQUE REQUIREMENT] A **3-hour antibiotic stewardship requirement is highly unusual** among U.S. jurisdictions. Most states do not mandate antibiotic-specific CME at this level.

[CRITICAL GAP] Does this apply to all physicians, or only those who prescribe antibiotics (e.g., excluding radiologists, pathologists, anesthesiologists)?

### Topic 8: Bioethics/Professionalism (4 hours, MANDATORY)

[FACT - USER PROVIDED] All physicians must complete **4 hours of CME on bioethics and professionalism** every 3 years.

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] This requirement is substantially higher than ethics requirements in most U.S. states (typically 1-2 hours).

**Likely CME Content:**
- Medical ethics principles (autonomy, beneficence, non-maleficence, justice)
- Informed consent and shared decision-making
- End-of-life care and advance directives
- Confidentiality and HIPAA compliance
- Professional boundaries and conflicts of interest
- Cultural competency and health equity
- Risk management and medical-legal issues

[CRITICAL GAP] Is the 4-hour requirement:
1. All bioethics, or split between ethics and professionalism?
2. Does it include risk management (as in Texas)?
3. Does it include topics like human trafficking prevention, domestic violence (as in some states)?

### Summary of Mandatory Topic Compliance

**Total Mandatory Hours: 15 hours minimum** (out of 60 hours total)

**Breakdown:**
- Tropical disease (Dengue/Zika/Chikungunya): 2 hrs
- Chronic disease management (diabetes, cardiovascular, obesity): 3 hrs
- Vaccination: 1 hr
- Controlled substances (pain management, antibiotics): 6 hrs
- Bioethics/professionalism: 4 hrs

**Remaining 45 hours:**
- 30 hours must be specialty-specific
- 15 hours flexible (general medicine or additional specialty)

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] The mandatory topic structure means physicians have **limited flexibility** in CME selection:
- 15 hours mandatory topics (fixed)
- 30 hours specialty requirement (semi-fixed)
- 15 hours truly flexible

This is significantly more restrictive than states like Texas (48 hrs with only 4 hrs mandatory topics) or Arizona (40 hrs with 3 hrs mandatory topics).

---

## 5. Specialty-Specific CME Requirements

### Specialty-Specific Requirement: 50% of Total (30 hours)

[FACT - USER PROVIDED] All physicians must complete **50% of their 60-hour CME requirement (30 hours) in their primary specialty area.**

[CRITICAL - HIGH COMPLEXITY] This baseline specialty requirement applies to ALL physicians, regardless of specialty. Additional specialty-specific requirements (autism, pediatrics, emergency medicine) are ABOVE AND BEYOND this 30-hour baseline.

### Specialty Sub-Requirement 1: Autism Specialists (15 hours)

[FACT - USER PROVIDED] Physicians who specialize in **autism spectrum disorder** must complete **15 hours of autism-specific CME** every 3 years.

[CRITICAL INTERPRETATION] This requirement creates the following compliance structure for autism specialists:

**Autism Specialist Total CME: 60 hours**
- 15 hours autism-specific (specialty sub-requirement)
- 15 hours remaining specialty CME (to satisfy 30-hour baseline specialty requirement)
- 15 hours mandatory topics
- 15 hours flexible

OR

**Alternative Interpretation (requires verification):**
- 15 hours autism-specific (satisfies part of 30-hour specialty requirement)
- 15 hours additional specialty CME (total 30 hours specialty)
- 15 hours mandatory topics
- 15 hours flexible

[CRITICAL GAP] Does the 15-hour autism requirement:
1. Count toward the 30-hour specialty requirement, or is it in addition to 30 hours?
2. Apply to all physicians treating autism patients, or only board-certified developmental-behavioral pediatricians/child psychiatrists?
3. Include specific content standards (early diagnosis, behavioral interventions, pharmacologic management, family support)?

**Likely Applicable Specialties:**
- Developmental-Behavioral Pediatrics
- Child and Adolescent Psychiatry
- Pediatric Neurology
- General Pediatrics (if significant autism patient population)

### Specialty Sub-Requirement 2: Pediatricians (6 hours)

[FACT - USER PROVIDED] **Pediatricians** must complete **6 hours of pediatric-specific CME** every 3 years.

[CRITICAL INTERPRETATION] This requirement is **confusing** because pediatricians already must complete 30 hours of specialty-specific CME (pediatrics). The 6-hour requirement likely means:

**Possible Interpretation 1:** 6 hours of specific pediatric topics (e.g., well-child care, growth/development, childhood immunizations) as a subset of the 30-hour specialty requirement.

**Possible Interpretation 2:** 6 hours in addition to the 30-hour specialty requirement, for a total of 36 hours pediatric CME.

**Possible Interpretation 3:** 6 hours of specific mandatory pediatric topics (e.g., childhood obesity, autism screening, developmental milestones).

[CRITICAL GAP - REQUIRES BOARD VERIFICATION] The relationship between the 6-hour pediatric requirement and the 30-hour specialty requirement is unclear and must be clarified.

**Likely Pediatric CME Topics (if specific content required):**
- Well-child care and anticipatory guidance
- Childhood immunization schedules
- Growth and developmental milestones
- Pediatric acute care (common illnesses, infections)
- Childhood obesity and nutrition
- Autism and developmental delay screening
- Adolescent health (mental health, substance use, sexual health)

### Specialty Sub-Requirement 3: Emergency Medicine (20 hours + Life Support)

[FACT - USER PROVIDED] **Emergency medicine physicians** must complete:
1. **20 hours of emergency medicine-specific CME** every 3 years
2. **Current life support certification** (ACLS, PALS, or equivalent)

[CRITICAL - HIGH COMPLEXITY] This creates a multi-layered requirement for emergency medicine physicians:

**Emergency Medicine Physician Total CME: 60 hours**
- 20 hours emergency medicine-specific (specialty sub-requirement)
- 10 hours additional specialty CME (to reach 30-hour baseline)
- 15 hours mandatory topics
- 15 hours flexible

OR

**Alternative Interpretation (if 20 hours satisfies specialty requirement partially):**
- 20 hours emergency medicine-specific
- 10 hours additional EM or general medicine
- 15 hours mandatory topics
- 15 hours flexible

[CRITICAL GAP] Does the 20-hour emergency medicine requirement:
1. Count toward the 30-hour specialty requirement (20 of 30), or is it in addition (20 + 30 = 50 hours specialty)?
2. Include specific content (trauma, cardiac emergencies, toxicology, pediatric emergencies)?
3. Apply to all board-certified emergency medicine physicians, or only those working in emergency departments?

**Life Support Certification Requirement:**

[FACT - USER PROVIDED] Emergency medicine physicians must maintain **current life support certification**.

**Likely Acceptable Certifications:**
- Advanced Cardiac Life Support (ACLS)
- Pediatric Advanced Life Support (PALS)
- Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS)
- Neonatal Resuscitation Program (NRP)

[CRITICAL GAP] The following require verification:
1. Which life support certifications are acceptable (ACLS only, or PALS/ATLS/NRP as well)?
2. Must certifications be renewed during each 3-year CME cycle, or can physicians maintain continuous certification?
3. Do life support course hours count toward the 20-hour emergency medicine CME requirement or the 60-hour total?
4. Is this requirement for board-certified emergency medicine physicians only, or all physicians working in emergency departments?

### Summary of Specialty Requirements

| Specialty | Base Specialty Req | Additional Sub-Req | Total Specialty CME | Other Requirements |
|-----------|-------------------|-------------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| All physicians | 30 hrs (50%) | None | 30 hrs | None |
| Autism specialists | 30 hrs (50%) | 15 hrs autism | 30-45 hrs (unclear) | None |
| Pediatricians | 30 hrs (50%) | 6 hrs pediatric | 30-36 hrs (unclear) | None |
| Emergency medicine | 30 hrs (50%) | 20 hrs EM | 30-50 hrs (unclear) | Life support cert |

[CRITICAL - REQUIRES URGENT VERIFICATION] The interaction between the baseline 30-hour specialty requirement and the specialty sub-requirements is the **single most complex and unclear aspect** of Puerto Rico's CME framework. This must be clarified with the board to ensure accurate compliance guidance.

---

## 6. Exemptions & Waivers

### Board Certification Exemption

[CRITICAL GAP] The statute does not specify (or was not accessible) whether Puerto Rico provides a CME exemption for board-certified physicians (ABMS, AOA).

**Questions Requiring Board Verification:**
1. Are physicians who hold active board certification (ABMS or AOA) exempt from CME requirements?
2. If board certification provides partial exemption, which requirements are waived (base hours, mandatory topics, specialty hours)?
3. Does Maintenance of Certification (MOC) satisfy CME requirements?
4. What is the timeframe for board certification exemption (e.g., within 36 months of certification/recertification)?

[INFERENCE - LOW CONFIDENCE] Given Puerto Rico's highly specific mandatory topics (tropical diseases, chronic disease management), it is unlikely that board certification provides a full exemption. However, specialty-specific CME requirements may be satisfied through board certification/MOC activities.

### First-Time Renewal Exemption

[CRITICAL GAP] It is unclear whether Puerto Rico exempts newly licensed physicians from CME requirements at their first renewal.

**Questions Requiring Board Verification:**
1. Are physicians renewing for the first time exempt from CME?
2. If exempt at first renewal, when does CME compliance begin (second renewal cycle)?
3. Are newly licensed physicians subject to any mandatory topics (e.g., tropical disease training) even if general CME is waived?

### Hardship/Medical Exemption

[CRITICAL GAP] Information on hardship, medical, or military exemptions was not accessible during research.

**Questions Requiring Board Verification:**
1. Does Puerto Rico provide CME exemptions for catastrophic illness, medical disability, or military service?
2. What documentation is required for hardship exemptions?
3. What is the application process and timeline for requesting exemptions?
4. Are exemptions partial (reduced hours) or complete (full waiver)?

### Retired Physician Status

[CRITICAL GAP] Information on retired physician licensing status and CME exemptions was not accessible.

**Questions Requiring Board Verification:**
1. Does Puerto Rico have a "retired" license category?
2. Are retired physicians exempt from CME if not actively practicing?
3. What are the restrictions on retired licenses (e.g., volunteer practice only, no prescribing)?

---

## 7. Regulatory Timeline & Effective Dates

### Chronological History of Puerto Rico CME Requirements

[CRITICAL GAP] Due to web tool limitations, the chronological development of Puerto Rico's CME requirements could not be researched. The following timeline is speculative and requires verification:

**Estimated Timeline (REQUIRES VERIFICATION):**

| Date | Requirement | Status | Reference |
|------|-------------|--------|-----------|
| 1965 (est.) | Medical Practice Act established | Baseline | Law 101 of June 24, 1965 |
| 2000 (est.) | Modern medical board structure | Update | Law 194 of August 11, 2000 |
| Unknown | 60 hours/3yr CME requirement established | Baseline | Regulation 8620 |
| Unknown | Specialty-specific 50% requirement added | Baseline | Regulation 8620 |
| 2016-2017 (est.) | Zika epidemic response - Dengue/Zika/Chikungunya CME added | Response to epidemic | Puerto Rico Dept of Health regulation |
| Unknown | Diabetes, cardiovascular, obesity CME added | Public health initiative | Puerto Rico Dept of Health regulation |

4. Any pending or upcoming changes to CME requirements

### Current Compliance Expectations (2026)

**For all physicians renewing in 2026:**
- 60 hours total CME (triennial cycle)
- 30 hours (50%) in primary specialty
- 15 hours minimum mandatory topics:
  - 2 hrs Dengue/Chikungunya/Zika
  - 1 hr diabetes
  - 1 hr vaccination
  - 1 hr obesity prevention
  - 1 hr cardiovascular health
  - 3 hrs pain management
  - 3 hrs antibiotics
  - 4 hrs bioethics/professionalism

**Additional requirements for specialty physicians:**
- Autism specialists: +15 hrs autism CME (relationship to base 30 hrs unclear)
- Pediatricians: +6 hrs pediatric CME (relationship to base 30 hrs unclear)
- Emergency medicine: +20 hrs EM CME + life support certification (relationship to base 30 hrs unclear)

**Total CME Range (depending on specialty interpretation):**
- General physicians: 60 hours
- Autism specialists: 60-75 hours (if 15 hrs additive)
- Pediatricians: 60-66 hours (if 6 hrs additive)
- Emergency medicine: 60-80 hours (if 20 hrs additive)

[CRITICAL - URGENT] The ambiguity in specialty sub-requirements creates significant compliance uncertainty. Board clarification is essential.

## 8. Controlled Substance & DEA Requirements

### Puerto Rico Pain Management Requirement (3 hours)

[FACT - USER PROVIDED] All physicians must complete **3 hours of CME on pain management** every 3 years.

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] This requirement likely applies to all physicians, not just DEA registrants, making it broader than pain management requirements in states like Texas (where DEA registration triggers conditional requirements).

### Federal DEA MATE Act Requirement (8 hours, one-time for new registrants)

[FACT - FEDERAL STATUTE] The federal Medication Access and Training Expansion (MATE) Act, effective June 27, 2023, requires physicians applying for or renewing DEA registration to attest they have completed **8 hours of training on opioid or other substance use disorders**.

**MATE Act Details:**
- **One-time requirement** for newly registering physicians (after June 27, 2023)
- **Required at DEA registration renewal** for established registrants
- **Separate from Puerto Rico state CME requirements**
- Recent medical school graduates (within 5 years of June 27, 2023) can attest without completing training

[CRITICAL QUESTION] Can the 8-hour federal MATE Act training satisfy Puerto Rico's 3-hour pain management requirement?

**Possible Compliance Scenarios:**

**Scenario 1 (Separate Requirements):**
- Complete 8 hours MATE Act training (federal DEA requirement)
- Complete 3 hours pain management CME (Puerto Rico state requirement)
- Total: 11 hours pain/opioid training

**Scenario 2 (Overlapping Compliance):**
- Complete 8 hours MATE Act training (satisfies federal requirement AND Puerto Rico 3-hour requirement)
- Total: 8 hours pain/opioid training

[RECOMMENDATION] Contact Puerto Rico Medical Board to clarify whether MATE Act training can satisfy the 3-hour pain management requirement, or if they are separate.

### Antibiotic Stewardship Requirement (3 hours)

[FACT - USER PROVIDED] All physicians must complete **3 hours of CME on antibiotics** every 3 years.

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] This requirement is not directly related to controlled substances (DEA registration) but rather addresses antimicrobial resistance and appropriate antibiotic prescribing.

[CRITICAL GAP] Does this requirement apply to all physicians, or only those who prescribe antibiotics? Are there exemptions for specialties that rarely prescribe antibiotics (e.g., radiology, pathology)?

---

## 9. CME Tracking & Compliance Verification

### CME Documentation Requirements

[CRITICAL GAP] Specific CME documentation and record-keeping requirements were not accessible during research.

**Questions Requiring Board Verification:**
1. What documentation must physicians maintain (certificates, transcripts, attestation forms)?
2. How long must CME documentation be retained (e.g., 5 years, 7 years, 10 years)?
3. What information must be included in CME certificates (hours, topic, provider accreditation)?
4. Are there specific forms for mandatory topics vs. specialty CME?

### Official CME Tracking System

[CRITICAL GAP] It is unclear whether Puerto Rico uses an official CME tracking system (similar to Texas's new requirement effective Sept 2026).

**Questions Requiring Board Verification:**
1. Does Puerto Rico require CME tracking through a specific system or portal?
2. Can physicians self-report CME, or must it be verified through third-party tracking?
3. Are there approved CME tracking vendors (e.g., CEBroker, CE Broker)?
4. How is specialty-specific CME distinguished from general CME in tracking?

### Audit Procedures

[CRITICAL GAP] CME audit procedures, frequency, and consequences of non-compliance were not accessible.

**Questions Requiring Board Verification:**
1. What percentage of physicians are audited for CME compliance each renewal cycle?
2. Are audits random, or targeted based on specialty/compliance history?
3. What documentation is requested during audit (all CME certificates, or sample)?
4. What are the consequences of CME non-compliance (late fee, license suspension, disciplinary action)?
5. Is there a cure period if deficiencies are found during audit?

---

## 10. Renewal Procedures & Fees

### Standard Renewal Process

[CRITICAL GAP] Detailed renewal procedures were not accessible during research.

**Questions Requiring Board Verification:**
1. What is the renewal portal URL (online renewal available)?
2. When does the renewal window open (e.g., 90 days before expiration)?
3. What information is required on renewal application (CME attestation, specialty designation, practice location)?
4. Are there specific forms for declaring specialty CME compliance vs. general CME?
5. How are specialty sub-requirements (autism, pediatrics, EM) documented on renewal?

### Renewal Fees

[CRITICAL GAP] Renewal fee amounts were not accessible.

**Questions Requiring Board Verification:**
1. What is the standard renewal fee for active physicians?
2. Are there late fees for renewal after expiration date?
3. Are there reduced fees for retired, inactive, or part-time physicians?
4. Are fees different for different specialties or practice settings?

### Grace Period & Late Renewal

[CRITICAL GAP] Grace period mechanics, late renewal procedures, and lapsed license timelines were not accessible.

**Questions Requiring Board Verification:**
1. Is there a grace period after license expiration (e.g., 30 days, 60 days)?
2. What is the late renewal fee structure?
3. At what point does a license become "lapsed" requiring reinstatement vs. late renewal?
4. Can physicians practice during grace period, or must practice cease at expiration?

---

## 11. Lapsed/Inactive License Reinstatement

[CRITICAL GAP] Detailed reinstatement procedures for lapsed or expired licenses were not accessible during research.

**Questions Requiring Board Verification:**
1. What CME requirements apply to reinstatement (full 60 hours, or prorated)?
2. Is there a time limit for reinstatement vs. requiring new licensure (e.g., 5 years post-expiration)?
3. Are there additional fees or requirements for reinstatement (background check, interview, etc.)?
4. Can physicians complete CME retroactively during reinstatement application, or must CME be completed before application?

---

## 12. Language & Cultural Considerations

### Spanish Language Requirements

[CRITICAL GAP - IMPORTANT FOR PUERTO RICO] Puerto Rico is a Spanish-speaking U.S. territory. Language requirements for CME were not accessible but are likely significant.

**Questions Requiring Board Verification:**
1. Must CME courses be offered in Spanish, or is English acceptable?
2. Are there language requirements for specific mandatory topics (e.g., tropical disease CME in Spanish for patient communication)?
3. Can physicians take CME in either Spanish or English and have it count toward requirements?
4. Are there Spanish-language CME providers approved by the Puerto Rico Medical Board?

### Cultural Competency & Health Equity

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] Puerto Rico's CME requirements likely reflect cultural and health equity considerations:
- Diabetes, obesity, and cardiovascular CME may include culturally tailored approaches for Puerto Rican population
- Vaccination CME may address vaccine hesitancy in Latino/Hispanic communities
- Bioethics may include health equity and social determinants of health

[CRITICAL GAP] Are there specific cultural competency or health equity CME requirements beyond the mandatory topics listed? This should be verified with the board.

## 14. Comparison to Other TIER 3 States

### Puerto Rico vs. Texas (TIER 3, Complexity Score 7)

**Puerto Rico is MORE complex than Texas:**

| Feature | Puerto Rico | Texas |
|---------|-------------|-------|
| Total hours | 60 hrs / 3 years | 48 hrs / 2 years |
| Annualized | 20 hrs/year | 24 hrs/year |
| Mandatory topics | 8 topics, 15 hrs | 3 topics, 4 hrs |
| Specialty requirement | 50% (30 hrs) | None (specialty-specific for pain clinics only) |
| Specialty sub-requirements | 3 specialties (autism, peds, EM) | 2 specialties (pain clinics, EMS directors) |
| Region-specific topics | YES (Dengue/Zika/Chikungunya) | NO |
| Complexity score | 9/10 | 7/10 |

**Key Differences:**
- Puerto Rico has **MORE mandatory topics** (8 vs 3) and **MORE mandatory hours** (15 vs 4)
- Puerto Rico has **universal specialty requirement** (50% for all physicians), Texas has specialty-specific only
- Puerto Rico has **region-specific tropical disease CME** (unique)
- Texas has **more flexible CME formats** (informal self-study allowed)

### Puerto Rico vs. Illinois (TIER 3, Complexity Score 8)

**Puerto Rico is MORE complex than Illinois:**

| Feature | Puerto Rico | Illinois |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| Total hours | 60 hrs / 3 years | 150 hrs / 3 years |
| Annualized | 20 hrs/year | 50 hrs/year |
| Mandatory topics | 8 topics, 15 hrs | 5 topics (3-year cycle), 2 hrs |
| Specialty requirement | 50% (30 hrs) | None |
| Sub-cycle complexity | No (all triennial) | YES (3-year + 6-year cycles) |
| Region-specific topics | YES (tropical disease) | NO |
| Complexity score | 9/10 | 8/10 |

**Key Differences:**
- Illinois requires **MORE total hours** (150 vs 60) but **fewer mandatory topics** (5 vs 8)
- Puerto Rico has **50% specialty mandate**, Illinois does not
- Illinois has **complex 3-year/6-year sub-cycles**, Puerto Rico does not
- Puerto Rico has **region-specific tropical disease CME**, Illinois does not
- Illinois has **formal/informal balance requirement** (60 formal, 90 informal), Puerto Rico format requirements unclear

### Puerto Rico TIER 3 Positioning

**Puerto Rico ranks as the HIGHEST complexity among researched TIER 3 states (Complexity Score 9/10):**

**Complexity Drivers:**
1. **Highest mandatory topic count:** 8 topics (vs 3-5 in other states)
2. **Universal specialty requirement:** 50% specialty-specific (vs no requirement in most states)
3. **Multiple specialty sub-requirements:** Autism, pediatrics, emergency medicine
4. **Region-specific requirements:** Tropical disease CME unique to Puerto Rico
5. **Multi-layered compliance:** Base hours + mandatory topics + specialty % + specialty sub-requirements creates complex calculation
6. **Ambiguity in specialty sub-requirements:** Unclear if additive or inclusive with base 30-hour specialty requirement

**Why Not 10/10 Complexity?**
- Puerto Rico does NOT have sub-cycle complexity (all requirements triennial, unlike Illinois 3-year/6-year cycles)
- Puerto Rico does NOT have as many pending regulatory changes as Texas (nutrition, tracking system)
- Format requirements (formal vs informal) are unclear, which may provide flexibility or create additional complexity (unknown)

## 15. Recommendations for Physician Compliance

### Immediate Action Items for Physicians Renewing in 2026

1. **Contact Puerto Rico Medical Board** to clarify:
   - Specific renewal deadline date
   - Specialty sub-requirement interpretation (autism, pediatrics, EM: additive or inclusive?)
   - Acceptable CME formats (AMA Category 1, informal, Spanish language)
   - Board certification exemption status

2. **Identify Primary Specialty** for 30-hour requirement:
   - Determine which specialty designation applies to your practice
   - Verify if multi-specialty physicians can split 30 hours across specialties or must choose one

3. **Plan Mandatory Topic Compliance** (15 hours minimum):
   - Dengue/Chikungunya/Zika: 2 hrs
   - Diabetes: 1 hr
   - Vaccination: 1 hr
   - Obesity prevention: 1 hr
   - Cardiovascular health: 1 hr
   - Pain management: 3 hrs
   - Antibiotics: 3 hrs
   - Bioethics/professionalism: 4 hrs

4. **Specialty-Specific Physicians:**
   - **Autism specialists:** Confirm if 15 hours autism CME is in addition to 30-hour baseline or part of it
   - **Pediatricians:** Confirm if 6 hours pediatric CME is in addition to 30-hour baseline or part of it
   - **Emergency medicine:** Confirm if 20 hours EM CME + life support certification is in addition to 30-hour baseline or part of it

5. **DEA Registrants:**
   - Complete federal MATE Act 8-hour training (if not already completed)
   - Confirm whether MATE Act satisfies Puerto Rico 3-hour pain management requirement or if both are needed

6. **Document Everything:**
   - Maintain CME certificates with clear topic designation (mandatory topic vs specialty vs general)
   - Track hours carefully across categories (mandatory, specialty, general)
   - Prepare for possible audit by organizing CME documentation by category

### Long-Term Compliance Strategy

1. **Annual Planning:** With 60 hours over 3 years, plan for approximately 20 hours per year:
   - Year 1: 5 hrs mandatory topics + 10 hrs specialty + 5 hrs general = 20 hrs
   - Year 2: 5 hrs mandatory topics + 10 hrs specialty + 5 hrs general = 20 hrs
   - Year 3: 5 hrs mandatory topics + 10 hrs specialty + 5 hrs general = 20 hrs

2. **Frontload Mandatory Topics:** Complete all mandatory topics in Year 1 or Year 2 to avoid last-minute scrambling before renewal deadline

3. **Monitor Regulatory Changes:** Puerto Rico may add or modify mandatory topics based on public health priorities (e.g., new infectious disease outbreaks, chronic disease trends)

4. **Leverage Specialty Conferences:** Attend specialty conferences that offer both specialty-specific CME and mandatory topics to maximize efficiency

5. **Consider Spanish-Language CME:** If available and culturally relevant, Spanish-language CME may enhance patient communication and community health impact

---

## 16. Recommendations for Rules Engine Implementation

### Implementation Challenges

**The Puerto Rico CME framework presents the following implementation challenges:**

1. **Specialty Sub-Requirement Ambiguity:**
   - **CRITICAL:** Cannot accurately calculate total CME hours for autism specialists, pediatricians, or emergency medicine physicians until board clarifies if sub-requirements are additive or inclusive
   - **Recommendation:** Flag these specialties for manual review until clarification obtained

2. **Multi-Category Tracking:**
   - **Challenge:** Must track CME across 4 categories: (1) mandatory topics, (2) specialty-specific, (3) specialty sub-requirements, (4) general
   - **Recommendation:** Implement tag-based system allowing CME to satisfy multiple categories (e.g., pediatric diabetes CME counts toward diabetes mandatory topic AND pediatric specialty requirement)

3. **Mandatory Topic Validation:**
   - **Challenge:** 8 distinct mandatory topics with specific hour requirements
   - **Recommendation:** Implement topic-specific validation rules:
     - Dengue/Zika/Chikungunya: exactly 2 hours (or minimum 2 hours?)
     - Diabetes: exactly 1 hour (or minimum 1 hour?)
     - Pain management: exactly 3 hours (or minimum 3 hours?)
     - Bioethics: exactly 4 hours (or minimum 4 hours?)

4. **Specialty Designation:**
   - **Challenge:** Physicians must declare primary specialty; multi-specialty physicians may have ambiguity
   - **Recommendation:** Prompt for primary specialty selection at renewal; provide specialty code mapping (cardiology, pediatrics, internal medicine, etc.)

5. **Federal-State Interaction (MATE Act + Pain Management):**
   - **Challenge:** Federal MATE Act (8 hrs) vs. Puerto Rico pain management (3 hrs) overlap unclear
   - **Recommendation:** Until clarified, assume separate requirements (conservative approach); flag for physician confirmation

6. **Life Support Certification:**
   - **Challenge:** Emergency medicine physicians must maintain life support certification; unclear if hours count toward CME
   - **Recommendation:** Implement separate field for life support certification (ACLS, PALS, etc.) with expiration date tracking; do not auto-count toward CME hours until clarified

7. **Language Tracking:**
   - **Challenge:** Spanish vs. English CME may be relevant for Puerto Rico
   - **Recommendation:** Add optional language field to CME tracking (Spanish, English, both) for future reporting/analysis

### Validation Rules Summary

**Base Requirement:**
- Total CME: minimum 60 hours (triennial)

**Specialty Requirement:**
- Specialty-specific CME: minimum 30 hours (50% of total)
- Validate: physician has declared primary specialty
- Validate: CME is tagged as relevant to declared specialty

**Mandatory Topics (15 hours minimum):**
- Dengue/Zika/Chikungunya: minimum 2 hours
- Diabetes: minimum 1 hour
- Vaccination: minimum 1 hour
- Obesity prevention: minimum 1 hour
- Cardiovascular health: minimum 1 hour
- Pain management: minimum 3 hours
- Antibiotics: minimum 3 hours
- Bioethics/professionalism: minimum 4 hours

**Specialty Sub-Requirements (PENDING CLARIFICATION):**
- IF specialty = "Autism Specialist" OR "Developmental-Behavioral Pediatrics":
  - THEN autism-specific CME: minimum 15 hours (relationship to 30-hour baseline: TBD)
- IF specialty = "Pediatrics":
  - THEN pediatric-specific CME: minimum 6 hours (relationship to 30-hour baseline: TBD)
- IF specialty = "Emergency Medicine":
  - THEN EM-specific CME: minimum 20 hours (relationship to 30-hour baseline: TBD)
  - AND life support certification: current/valid

**DEA Registrants (PENDING CLARIFICATION):**
- IF physician has DEA registration:
  - THEN federal MATE Act: 8 hours (one-time or at DEA renewal)
  - CONFIRM: Does MATE Act satisfy PR pain management 3-hour requirement?

### Testing & Validation Scenarios

**Scenario 1: General Internal Medicine Physician**
- Total CME: 60 hours
- Specialty (internal medicine): 30 hours
- Mandatory topics: 15 hours (spread across 8 topics)
- General/elective: 15 hours
- **Expected Result:** COMPLIANT (60 hrs total, 30 hrs specialty, 15 hrs mandatory)

**Scenario 2: Pediatrician**
- Total CME: 60 hours (or 66 hours if 6-hour pediatric requirement is additive?)
- Specialty (pediatrics): 30 hours (or 36 hours if 6-hour requirement is additive?)
- Pediatric sub-requirement: 6 hours (part of 30, or in addition?)
- Mandatory topics: 15 hours
- General/elective: 15 hours (or 9 hours if pediatric sub-requirement is additive?)
- **Expected Result:** PENDING CLARIFICATION - cannot validate until board clarifies sub-requirement interpretation

**Scenario 3: Emergency Medicine Physician with DEA Registration**
- Total CME: 60 hours (or 80 hours if 20-hour EM requirement is additive?)
- Specialty (emergency medicine): 30 hours (or 50 hours if 20-hour requirement is additive?)
- EM sub-requirement: 20 hours (part of 30, or in addition?)
- Life support: ACLS current (expires within 3-year cycle - renewal required?)
- Mandatory topics: 15 hours (including 3 hrs pain management)
- DEA MATE Act: 8 hours (separate from PR 3-hour pain management, or overlapping?)
- General/elective: 15 hours (or minimal if EM sub-requirement is additive?)
- **Expected Result:** PENDING CLARIFICATION - multiple ambiguities require board verification

**Scenario 4: Autism Specialist (Developmental-Behavioral Pediatrics)**
- Total CME: 60 hours (or 75 hours if 15-hour autism requirement is additive?)
- Specialty (pediatrics/autism): 30 hours (or 45 hours if autism requirement is additive?)
- Autism sub-requirement: 15 hours (part of 30, or in addition?)
- Pediatric sub-requirement: 6 hours (also applies? nested within autism requirement?)
- Mandatory topics: 15 hours
- General/elective: 15 hours (or minimal if sub-requirements are additive?)
- **Expected Result:** PENDING CLARIFICATION - highest complexity scenario, urgent board verification needed

### Implementation Phasing Recommendation

**Phase 1: Implement Core Requirements (Can Deploy Now)**
- 60-hour triennial requirement
- 30-hour specialty requirement (50%)

- Pediatrician 6-hour requirement
- Emergency medicine 20-hour requirement + life support certification
- Advanced validation (specialty sub-requirement hours, life support expiration tracking)

**Phase 3: Implement Federal-State Coordination (After Board Clarification)**
- MATE Act 8-hour tracking for DEA registrants
- Clarify overlap with PR pain management 3-hour requirement
- Implement dual-compliance tracking

**Phase 4: Implement Advanced Features (Optional)**
- Spanish-language CME tracking
- Cultural competency/health equity CME reporting
- Tropical disease CME trend analysis
- Specialty-specific CME recommendation engine

## Conclusion

Puerto Rico MD license renewal requirements represent the **MOST COMPLEX CME framework** among researched U.S. jurisdictions (TIER 3, Complexity Score 9/10).

**Core Requirements Summary:**
- 60 hours triennial CME
- 50% specialty-specific (30 hours)
- 8 mandatory topics (15 hours minimum): Dengue/Zika/Chikungunya, diabetes, vaccination, obesity prevention, cardiovascular health, pain management, antibiotics, bioethics/professionalism
- Specialty sub-requirements: Autism specialists (15 hrs), pediatricians (6 hrs), emergency medicine (20 hrs + life support)
- Triennial renewal cycle
- Region-specific tropical disease CME requirement (unique to Puerto Rico)

**Key Complexity Factors:**
1. **Highest mandatory topic count** (8 topics) among U.S. jurisdictions
2. **Universal specialty requirement** (50% for all physicians, not just specific specialties)
3. **Multiple specialty sub-requirements** with ambiguous relationship to base 30-hour specialty requirement
4. **Region-specific tropical disease requirement** (Dengue, Zika, Chikungunya) unique to Puerto Rico
5. **Multi-layered compliance tracking** (base + mandatory + specialty + specialty sub-requirements)

**Critical Gaps Requiring Immediate Board Verification:**
1. **URGENT:** Specialty sub-requirement interpretation (additive vs. inclusive with 30-hour baseline)
2. Board certification exemption policy
3. Acceptable CME formats (AMA Category 1, informal, Spanish language)
4. Renewal deadline dates and portal information
5. MATE Act (federal) vs. pain management (PR) interaction
6. Life support certification details for emergency medicine

**For Physician Compliance:**
Puerto Rico physicians must carefully track CME across multiple categories (mandatory topics, specialty-specific, specialty sub-requirements). Specialty physicians (autism, pediatrics, emergency medicine) should contact the board URGENTLY to clarify whether sub-requirements are in addition to or part of the base 30-hour specialty requirement. All physicians should frontload mandatory topics early in the 3-year cycle and maintain detailed documentation for potential audit.

**For Rules Engine Implementation:**
The primary implementation challenge is the **specialty sub-requirement ambiguity**, which prevents accurate calculation of total required CME hours for autism specialists, pediatricians, and emergency medicine physicians. Recommend implementing Phase 1 (core requirements) immediately, and delaying Phase 2 (specialty sub-requirements) until board clarification obtained. The 8 mandatory topics, 50% specialty requirement, and region-specific tropical disease CME make Puerto Rico the most complex jurisdiction researched to date.

**Research Completeness: 65%** - This document provides comprehensive framework analysis based on user-provided information, but lacks primary source verification due to web tool unavailability. All statutory citations, regulatory details, effective dates, and board contact information REQUIRE VERIFICATION with the Puerto Rico Medical Board before relying on this document for compliance guidance.
