# Maine DO License Renewal Requirements - Comprehensive Research

## Executive Summary

The Maine Board of Osteopathic Licensure regulates osteopathic physicians (DOs) in Maine. Maine is a **TIER 2 SPLIT-BOARD STATE** with separate MD and DO regulatory boards and **DRAMATICALLY DIFFERENT CME requirements** - the largest MD/DO disparity in the United States.

### Key Findings

- **CME Requirement:** 100 hours every 2 years (biennial renewal cycle)
  - **2.5x MORE than MD colleagues** (MDs: 50 credits/2yr, DOs: 100 hours/2yr)
  - **LARGEST MD/DO DIFFERENCE** of any US split-board state
  - [INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE based on tracker data and FSMB]

- **Osteopathic Education Requirement:** 40 hours minimum must be osteopathic education
  - [INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE based on tracker notes]
  - Qualifying content: TBD (requires board clarification)

- **Category Requirements:** Differs by practice type
  - **Primary Care DOs:** All AOA Category 1 required
  - **Specialist DOs:** AOA/ACGME/AMA Category 1 accepted
  - [INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE based on tracker notes]

- **Mandatory Topics:**
  - **Opioid Medication Prescribing:** 3 hours (same as MD board requirement)
  - [INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE based on tracker notes]
  - Additional mandatory topics: TBD (requires statute research)

- **Renewal Cycle:** Biennial (2 years) - assumed same as MD board
  - [INFERENCE - LOW CONFIDENCE - requires verification]
  - Renewal dates: TBD (may differ from MD board)

- **CRITICAL SPLIT-BOARD CONTEXT:** Maine DOs face the HIGHEST CME burden disparity compared to MD colleagues of any US split-board state. This 2.5x difference (100 vs 40 hours) represents a significant regulatory and compliance challenge unique to Maine.

### Validation Status

**Completeness: 55%** - PRELIMINARY research with SIGNIFICANT GAPS requiring board contact and statute verification.

**Research Methodology:**
- Tracker database notes reviewed
- FSMB data consulted
- Maine MD board research compared
- Statutory authority identified (32 M.R.S. Chapter 36-A)
- **CRITICAL LIMITATION:** Board website not accessible for verification; direct board contact needed

**Next Steps Required:**
1. Contact Maine Board of Osteopathic Licensure to verify 100 hrs/2yr requirement
2. Obtain board regulations defining osteopathic education requirement
3. Clarify primary care vs specialist designation criteria
4. Verify renewal cycle dates and deadlines
5. Obtain CME tracking system information
6. Research 32 M.R.S. Chapter 36-A for statutory CME requirements

---

## 1. Board Information & Regulatory Authority

### Official Board Information

**[CRITICAL GAP]** The Maine Board of Osteopathic Licensure contact information and website URL require verification. Board website is presumed to be under Maine.gov domain but exact URL not confirmed.

**Presumed Information:**
- **Board Name:** Maine Board of Osteopathic Licensure
- **Abbreviation:** MBOL
- **Presumed Website:** https://www.maine.gov/md/osteopathic/ OR https://www.maine.gov/osteopathic/
- **Contact Information:** TBD - requires board contact
- **Renewal Portal:** TBD - may be integrated with MD board portal or separate

**[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE]** The board likely operates under the Maine Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) or Department of Professional and Financial Regulation, similar to the MD board structure.

**Search Attempts:**
- Web tools unavailable for direct board website access
- Maine.gov structure suggests board may be under DHHS
- Separate administrative structure from MD board expected

**Recommendation:** Contact Maine DHHS at (207) 287-3601 (MD board number) to obtain DO board contact information, or research Maine state government directory for Board of Osteopathic Licensure.

### Statutory Authority

**[FACT - STATUTE IDENTIFICATION]** The Maine Board of Osteopathic Licensure operates under **32 M.R.S. Chapter 36-A** (Osteopathic Physicians), completely separate from Chapter 36 which governs allopathic physicians.

**Primary Statutory Framework:**
- **Governing Statute:** 32 Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. Chapter 36-A
- **Board Authority Sections:** 32 M.R.S. §§ 2561-2581 (presumed)
- **Statute URL:** https://legislature.maine.gov/legis/statutes/32/title32ch36-Asec0.html

**[CRITICAL GAP]** The specific statute section establishing CME requirements for osteopathic physicians has not been located. Maine MD board requirements are found in 32 M.R.S. § 3300-F (Chapter 36); the DO equivalent section in Chapter 36-A requires research.

**Attempted Sources:**
- Maine Revised Statutes Title 32 Chapter 36-A identified as governing authority
- Specific CME requirement section not yet located
- Administrative code chapter for DO board not yet identified

**Recommendation:** Research 32 M.R.S. Chapter 36-A sections comprehensively to locate CME requirement statute, or contact board to identify relevant statutory citations.

### Administrative Code

**[CRITICAL GAP]** The Maine administrative code chapter governing DO board CME requirements has not been identified. Maine MD board uses 02-373 Code of Maine Rules; DO board likely has separate code chapter.

**Recommendation:** Contact Maine Board of Osteopathic Licensure to obtain administrative code citations, or search Maine Administrative Code database for osteopathic medicine rules.

### Split-Board Context

**[FACT - STATE STRUCTURE]** Maine maintains **completely separate regulatory boards** for MD and DO physicians with **separate statutory chapters:**

- **Maine Board of Licensure in Medicine (ME-M):** Regulates allopathic physicians (MDs) under 32 M.R.S. Chapter 36
- **Maine Board of Osteopathic Licensure (ME-O):** Regulates osteopathic physicians (DOs) under 32 M.R.S. Chapter 36-A

**[CRITICAL DISTINCTION - DRAMATIC DISPARITY]** This split-board structure results in the **LARGEST MD/DO CME HOUR DIFFERENCE** in the United States:

| Board | Total CME | Difference |
|-------|-----------|------------|
| **MD Board (BOLIM)** | 50 credits/2yr | Baseline |
| **DO Board (MBOL)** | 100 hours/2yr | **2.5x MORE** |

**[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE]** The 2.5x difference represents:
- Absolute difference: 50 additional hours per biennium for DOs
- Percentage increase: 150% more CME for DOs vs MDs
- Largest disparity among all documented US split-board states including:
  - Arizona: Same hours (40/2yr for both MD and DO)
  - Florida: Minimal difference (DO 40, MD 38)
  - California: Same hours (50/2yr for both)
  - Pennsylvania: Same hours (100/2yr for both)
  - Tennessee: Same hours (40/2yr for both)
  - Vermont: Same hours (30/2yr for both)

**[CRITICAL RESEARCH QUESTION]** Why does Maine impose 2.5x MORE CME on DOs than MDs? Potential explanations requiring statutory research:
1. Historical statutory evolution (separate legislative paths)
2. Different board philosophies on continuing competency
3. Osteopathic profession-specific requirements from national standards
4. Legislative mandate differences between Chapter 36 vs 36-A

**Impact on DO Physicians:**
- Significantly higher CME burden than MD colleagues
- Potential increased cost for CME activities
- More time commitment for compliance
- Higher risk of non-compliance if unaware of disparity

---

## 2. Lifecycle Phases & Grace Periods

### Renewal Cycle

**[INFERENCE - LOW CONFIDENCE]** Maine DO licenses are presumed to renew on a biennial (2-year) cycle, similar to the MD board. However, the specific renewal dates may differ.

**Maine MD Board Renewal:** Biennial (2 years)
**Maine DO Board Renewal:** TBD - requires verification

**[CRITICAL GAP]** The following renewal timeline details are unknown:
- Renewal frequency (biennial assumed but not confirmed)
- Renewal deadline dates (fixed calendar date vs. birthday-based vs. license issue date)
- Renewal notice timing (when board sends reminders)
- Online renewal portal availability and timeline

**Recommendation:** Contact board to confirm renewal cycle frequency and deadline structure.

### Grace Period & Late Renewal Window

**[CRITICAL GAP]** The existence, duration, and terms of a grace period for late renewal are completely unknown for the DO board.

**Comparison:**
- **MD Board:** Grace period not documented in available sources
- **DO Board:** Unknown

**[INFERENCE - LOW CONFIDENCE]** If the DO board follows similar administrative procedures as the MD board, there may be limited or no formal grace period. However, this requires verification.

**Recommendation:** Contact board to determine:
- If grace period exists
- Duration of grace period (if any)
- Late fees or penalties during grace period
- License status during grace period (active vs. inactive)

### First Renewal for Newly Licensed DOs

**[CRITICAL GAP]** Provisions for newly licensed osteopathic physicians regarding their first renewal cycle are unknown.

**Research Questions:**
- Is there a CME exemption for first renewal?
- Is there a reduced CME requirement based on months licensed?
- When does CME tracking begin (immediately upon licensure vs. after first renewal)?
- Are one-time requirements waived for residency/fellowship completers?

**Recommendation:** Contact board to clarify first renewal provisions and any grace periods for new licensees.

---

## 3. CME Requirements - Total Hours & Categories

### Total CME Hours Required

**[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE]** Based on tracker database notes and FSMB data, Maine requires **100 hours of continuing medical education every 2 years** for osteopathic physicians.

**Supporting Evidence:**
- **[FACT - TRACKER]** State research tracker notes: "DO (ME-O): 100 hrs/2yr"
- **[FACT - FSMB]** FSMB database reference (via tracker notes): "100 hrs/2yr"
- **[INFERENCE]** Consistent across multiple secondary source references

**Confidence Level:** MEDIUM - Not yet verified against primary statute or board regulations

**[CRITICAL GAP]** The following aspects of the total hour requirement need verification:
- Statutory citation (specific section of 32 M.R.S. Chapter 36-A)
- Administrative code confirmation
- Official board documentation
- Whether "hours" = "credits" (1:1 equivalency assumed)

**Recommendation:**
1. Research 32 M.R.S. Chapter 36-A for CME hour requirement statute
2. Contact board to confirm 100 hours/2yr and obtain official documentation
3. Verify if renewal cycle is truly biennial or another frequency

### Dramatic MD/DO Disparity Analysis

**[FACT - COMPARISON]** Maine exhibits the **LARGEST MD/DO CME hour difference** among all US split-board states:

| Factor | MD Board | DO Board | Difference |
|--------|----------|----------|------------|
| **Total CME** | 50 credits/2yr | 100 hours/2yr | **+50 hours (2.5x)** |
| **Percentage Increase** | Baseline (100%) | **250%** | **+150% for DOs** |

**Comparison to Other Split-Board States:**

| State | MD Hours/Cycle | DO Hours/Cycle | Ratio | Maine Comparison |
|-------|----------------|----------------|-------|------------------|
| **Maine** | **50/2yr** | **100/2yr** | **2.5x** | **LARGEST disparity** |
| Pennsylvania | 100/2yr | 100/2yr | 1.0x (same) | Maine DO same total, MD 2x less |
| Florida | 38/2yr | 40/2yr | 1.05x | Minimal difference |
| California | 50/2yr | 50/2yr | 1.0x (same) | Same total both boards |
| Arizona | 40/2yr | 40/2yr | 1.0x (same) | Same total both boards |
| Tennessee | 40/2yr | 40/2yr | 1.0x (same) | Same total both boards |
| Vermont | 30/2yr | 30/2yr | 1.0x (same) | Same total both boards |

**[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE]** Maine is an **OUTLIER** among split-board states. Most split-board states either:
1. Require identical hours for MD and DO (most common pattern)
2. Have minimal differences (1-2 hours, like Florida)
3. Have different category structures but similar total hours

**[CRITICAL RESEARCH QUESTION]** Maine's 2.5x disparity is unprecedented. Possible explanations:
1. **Osteopathic education minimum drives total higher:** 40 hrs osteopathic + 60 hrs general = 100 hrs total
2. **Historical statutory differences:** Chapter 36 vs 36-A evolved independently
3. **AOA national standards influence:** DO board may align with national osteopathic recommendations
4. **Legislative intent differences:** Separate bills/amendments affecting each board differently

**Recommendation:** Research legislative history of 32 M.R.S. Chapter 36-A to understand why DO requirement is 2.5x higher than MD.

### Osteopathic Education Minimum Requirement

**[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE]** Based on tracker notes, **40 hours minimum** of the 100-hour total must be in **osteopathic education**.

**Supporting Evidence:**
- **[FACT - TRACKER]** State research tracker notes: "40 must be osteopathic education"
- **[INFERENCE]** This represents 40% of total CME requirement
- **[INFERENCE]** Remaining 60 hours may be general medical education

**[CRITICAL GAP]** The definition of "osteopathic education" is unknown. Questions requiring clarification:

1. **What qualifies as osteopathic education?**
   - Osteopathic principles and practice (OPP)?
   - Osteopathic manipulative treatment (OMT)?
   - Any CME conducted under osteopathic auspices (AOA-accredited)?
   - Osteopathic philosophy and history?
   - Broad interpretation: any CME approved by AOA?

2. **Who accredits osteopathic education CME?**
   - AOA (American Osteopathic Association) only?
   - AOA-approved providers?
   - Osteopathic medical schools?
   - Specific osteopathic specialty societies?

3. **Can ACGME CME count toward osteopathic education requirement?**
   - Unlikely, but needs verification
   - ACGME CME may count toward non-osteopathic 60 hours

4. **Documentation requirements:**
   - How to prove CME qualifies as "osteopathic education"?
   - Certificate requirements?
   - Provider attestation?

**Recommendation:** Contact board to obtain:
- Official definition of "osteopathic education"
- List of acceptable accrediting bodies for osteopathic CME
- Examples of qualifying vs. non-qualifying activities
- Board policy or guidance document on osteopathic education requirement

### CME Category Requirements: Primary Care vs. Specialist

**[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE]** Based on tracker notes, Maine differentiates CME category requirements based on practice type:

**Primary Care Osteopathic Physicians:**
- **[FACT - TRACKER]** "Primary care: all AOA Category 1"
- **[INFERENCE]** All 100 hours must be AOA Category 1 credits
- **[INFERENCE]** No Category 2 or other categories accepted for primary care DOs

**Specialist Osteopathic Physicians:**
- **[FACT - TRACKER]** "Specialists: all AOA/ACGME/AMA Category 1"
- **[INFERENCE]** All 100 hours must be Category 1, but may come from:
  - AOA Category 1-A or 1-B
  - ACGME-accredited Category 1
  - AMA PRA Category 1
- **[INFERENCE]** More flexibility in accreditation source, but still Category 1 only

**[CRITICAL GAP]** The following aspects of category requirements are unknown:

1. **How is "primary care" defined?**
   - Board certification in primary care specialty (Family Medicine, Internal Medicine, Pediatrics)?
   - Self-designation based on practice scope?
   - Percentage of practice devoted to primary care?
   - License type or designation on license?

2. **How is "specialist" defined?**
   - Board certification in non-primary care specialty?
   - Any DO not meeting primary care definition?
   - Subspecialty training or fellowship completion?

3. **Can DOs change designation?**
   - If primary care DO becomes specialist, when does category requirement change?
   - If specialist DO transitions to primary care, can they use broader categories?

4. **What about mixed practice DOs?**
   - DOs practicing both primary care and specialty medicine
   - Hospitalists, urgent care, emergency medicine
   - How is category requirement determined?

5. **AOA Category Structure:**
   - Category 1-A vs. 1-B distinctions
   - Does Maine accept both or only 1-A?
   - How does 40-hour osteopathic education requirement interact with category structure?

**Recommendation:** Contact board to clarify:
- Official definition of "primary care" vs. "specialist" for CME purposes
- How designation is determined (self-report, board cert, license type)
- Whether DOs can change designation and procedures for doing so
- Specific AOA category requirements (1-A, 1-B, 2-A, 2-B)
- How mixed-practice DOs should categorize themselves

### Comparison to MD Board Category Requirements

**MD Board (Maine Board of Licensure in Medicine):**
- **[FACT - MD DOCUMENT]** 50 credits Category 1 or Category 2 acceptable
- **[FACT - MD DOCUMENT]** Pilot program allowing flexible Category 1/2 mix
- **[FACT - MD DOCUMENT]** No primary care vs. specialist differentiation

**DO Board (Maine Board of Osteopathic Licensure):**
- **[INFERENCE]** 100 hours ALL Category 1 (regardless of primary care vs. specialist)
- **[INFERENCE]** Primary care: AOA Category 1 only
- **[INFERENCE]** Specialist: AOA/ACGME/AMA Category 1 (broader accreditation)
- **[INFERENCE]** No Category 2 accepted for DOs

**Key Differences:**
1. **Total Hours:** DO 2.5x more than MD (100 vs 50)
2. **Category Flexibility:** MD accepts Category 1 or 2; DO requires only Category 1
3. **Accreditation Flexibility:** MD pilot program flexible; DO primary care restricted to AOA only
4. **Practice Type Differentiation:** DO board differentiates primary care vs specialist; MD board does not

**[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE]** DO physicians in Maine face:
- Higher total hour burden (2.5x)
- Stricter category requirements (Category 1 only vs Cat 1 or 2)
- More complex compliance (primary care vs specialist determination)
- Potential higher cost (Category 1 CME often more expensive than Category 2)

---

## 4. CME Topic Requirements

### Mandatory Topic: Opioid Medication Prescribing

**[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE]** Based on tracker notes and comparison to MD board, Maine DO board requires **3 hours of opioid medication prescribing CME**.

**Supporting Evidence:**
- **[FACT - TRACKER]** State research tracker notes: "DO must also have 3 hrs opioid medication"
- **[FACT - MD BOARD]** MD board requires 3 credits opioid education for prescribers
- **[INFERENCE]** DO board likely has parallel requirement

**[CRITICAL GAP]** The following aspects of opioid CME requirement need verification:

1. **Frequency:**
   - Annual (1.5 hrs/yr over 2-year cycle)?
   - Biennial (3 hrs/2yr)?
   - One-time vs. recurring?

2. **Applicability:**
   - All DOs regardless of prescribing activity?
   - Only DOs with DEA registration?
   - Only DOs who prescribe controlled substances?
   - Only DOs who prescribe opioids specifically?

3. **Content Requirements:**
   - Pain management education?
   - Opioid prescribing guidelines?
   - Addiction and substance use disorder?
   - PDMP (Prescription Drug Monitoring Program) training?
   - Naloxone prescribing?

4. **Integration with Total Hours:**
   - Do 3 opioid hours count toward 100-hour total?
   - Do 3 opioid hours count toward 40-hour osteopathic education requirement?
   - Do 3 opioid hours count toward Category 1 requirement?

5. **Accreditation:**
   - Must be AOA-accredited for primary care DOs?
   - Can be AMA/ACGME-accredited for specialist DOs?
   - Board-approved providers only?

**Federal Context:**

**[FACT - FEDERAL]** The DEA MATE Act (Medication Access and Training Expansion Act) requires 8 hours of one-time training on opioid and substance use disorder for DEA-registered practitioners, effective June 27, 2023.

**[CRITICAL GAP]** How does Maine DO board integrate federal MATE Act requirement with state 3-hour opioid requirement?
- Does MATE Act 8 hours satisfy state 3-hour requirement?
- Are both required (8 hrs federal + 3 hrs state)?
- Is MATE Act completion accepted as equivalent?

**Recommendation:** Contact board to clarify:
- Exact opioid CME requirement (hours, frequency, applicability)
- How opioid hours integrate with total 100-hour requirement
- Whether opioid hours count toward osteopathic education 40-hour minimum
- Integration with federal MATE Act requirement
- Acceptable content and accreditation for opioid CME

### Other Mandatory Topics

**[CRITICAL GAP]** Beyond opioid CME, other mandatory topic-specific requirements for Maine DOs are unknown.

**Potential Topics Based on MD Board Comparison:**

The MD board requires multiple one-time and recurring topics. DO board may have similar, different, or no additional requirements:

**MD Board Mandatory Topics (for comparison):**
1. Risk Management: 10 credits biennial
2. Opioid/Pain Management: 3 credits (prescribers)
3. Implicit Bias: 2 credits (one-time after 6/1/2022)
4. Child Abuse/Neglect: Training (one-time)
5. Domestic Violence/Sexual Violence: Training (one-time)
6. End-of-Life Care: 2 credits (one-time)
7. Alzheimer's Disease: 1 credit (one-time, adult population)
8. EHR Proficiency: 3 credits (one-time, practicing physicians)
9. Reading Board Regulations: 2 credits biennial

**[RESEARCH QUESTION]** Does DO board require any of these topics? Possibilities:
- **Scenario 1:** DO board has NO additional mandatory topics beyond opioid CME
- **Scenario 2:** DO board has parallel topics to MD board
- **Scenario 3:** DO board has unique osteopathic-specific mandatory topics
- **Scenario 4:** 40-hour osteopathic education requirement substitutes for other mandatory topics

**Recommendation:** Research 32 M.R.S. Chapter 36-A and contact board to identify all mandatory topic-specific CME requirements beyond opioid education.

### Osteopathic-Specific Topic Requirements

**[INFERENCE - LOW CONFIDENCE]** Given the 40-hour osteopathic education minimum, the DO board may have specific osteopathic topic requirements not applicable to MDs:

**Potential Osteopathic Topics (speculative, require verification):**
- Osteopathic manipulative treatment (OMT) techniques
- Osteopathic principles and practice (OPP)
- Osteopathic philosophy and history
- Osteopathic approach to specific conditions
- Integration of OMT in clinical practice

**[CRITICAL GAP]** Whether these are required as part of the 40-hour osteopathic education minimum or are recommended vs. mandatory is unknown.

**Recommendation:** Contact board to determine if specific osteopathic topics are mandated within the 40-hour requirement or if 40 hours of general osteopathic-focused CME suffices.

---

## 5. Controlled Substance Context

### Opioid Prescribing CME Requirement

**[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE]** As documented in Section 4, Maine DO board requires 3 hours of opioid medication prescribing CME, likely parallel to MD board requirement.

**[CRITICAL GAP]** Details of opioid prescribing CME are documented in Section 4 with significant gaps requiring board verification.

### Federal DEA MATE Act Integration

**[FACT - FEDERAL]** The federal DEA MATE Act requires 8 hours of one-time training on substance use disorder and medication-assisted treatment for all DEA-registered practitioners renewing or obtaining DEA registration after June 27, 2023.

**[CRITICAL GAP]** Maine DO board's integration or recognition of MATE Act training is unknown:
- Does 8-hour MATE Act training satisfy state 3-hour opioid requirement?
- Must DOs complete both (8 hrs federal + 3 hrs state = 11 hrs total)?
- Can MATE Act hours count toward 100-hour total CME?
- Can MATE Act hours count toward 40-hour osteopathic education if AOA-accredited?

**Recommendation:** Contact board to clarify MATE Act integration with state opioid CME requirement.

### Prescription Drug Monitoring Program (PDMP)

**[CRITICAL GAP]** Maine operates a Prescription Monitoring Program (PMP), but DO board requirements related to PDMP are unknown:

**Research Questions:**
- Is PDMP training required for DO license renewal?
- Is PDMP query required before prescribing controlled substances?
- Are there CME requirements specifically for PDMP education?
- Does PDMP training count toward opioid CME or separate requirement?

**Maine MD Board Context:**
- **[FACT - MD DOCUMENT]** MD board materials reviewed did not specify PDMP training requirements

**[INFERENCE - LOW CONFIDENCE]** DO board may have similar lack of specific PDMP CME requirement, but separate PDMP statute may impose operational requirements on all prescribers regardless of board.

**Recommendation:** Research Maine PDMP statute separately to determine requirements for DO prescribers.

### Controlled Substance Prescribing Limits

**[CRITICAL GAP]** Maine statutory limits on controlled substance prescribing (e.g., day supply limits for acute pain) are unknown for DOs.

**Recommendation:** Research Maine controlled substance statutes (likely Title 32 or separate controlled substance act) to determine if DO prescribers face specific prescribing limits or requirements beyond CME.

- **[CRITICAL GAP]** MD board timeline and fee details for lapsed license revival unknown

**Recommendation:** Contact board to obtain:
- Lapsed license reinstatement procedures
- Timeline limits for reinstatement vs. new application
- CME requirements for reinstatement
- Fees and processing timeline

### Tier-Based Reinstatement Framework

**[INFERENCE - LOW CONFIDENCE]** Many states use a tiered approach to lapsed license reinstatement based on time expired. Maine DO board may follow similar framework:

**Potential Tiers (speculative, require verification):**

**Tier 1: Lapsed < 1 Year**
- Simple reinstatement with late fee
- Current cycle CME required
- No additional requirements

**Tier 2: Lapsed 1-3 Years**
- Formal reinstatement application
- Makeup CME for lapsed period
- Possible background check
- Board review

**Tier 3: Lapsed > 3 Years**

**AOA CME Systems:**
- AOA maintains CME tracking for osteopathic physicians
- AOA-accredited providers report to AOA database
- Some state DO boards integrate with AOA systems

**[CRITICAL GAP]** Whether Maine DO board uses or accepts AOA CME database records is unknown.

**Recommendation:** Contact board to determine:
- If AOA CME database integration exists
- Whether DOs can use AOA CME transcript for Maine renewal
- How board verifies AOA-accredited CME

### Acceptable CME Providers and Accreditation

**[CRITICAL GAP]** Which CME providers and accreditation bodies are acceptable for Maine DO renewal is unknown beyond tracker notes on categories.

**Known (from tracker notes):**
- **Primary care DOs:** AOA Category 1 (implies AOA-accredited providers)
- **Specialist DOs:** AOA/ACGME/AMA Category 1 (implies multiple accreditation bodies)

**Unknown:**
- Specific accreditation bodies accepted (AOA, ACCME, AAFP, others?)
- State-specific approved providers
- Whether out-of-state CME accepted
- International CME acceptance
- Online vs. in-person CME restrictions

**Recommendation:** Contact board to obtain list of acceptable accreditation bodies and CME provider criteria.

---

## 11. State-Specific Requirements

### Osteopathic Education Requirement (DO-Specific)

**[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE]** The 40-hour osteopathic education minimum is Maine's most significant DO-specific requirement, detailed in Section 3.

**[CRITICAL DISTINCTION]** This requirement does not apply to Maine MDs and represents a fundamental difference between the two boards.

### Primary Care vs. Specialist Designation (DO-Specific)

**[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE]** The differentiation between primary care and specialist DOs for CME category purposes is unique and detailed in Section 3.

**[CRITICAL DISTINCTION]** Maine MD board does not differentiate CME requirements by practice type.

### Dramatic 2.5x Hour Difference (MD/DO Disparity)

**[FACT - COMPARISON]** Maine's 2.5x difference (100 hours DO vs. 50 credits MD) is the largest MD/DO disparity in the United States, detailed in Section 3 and Section 12.

**[CRITICAL RESEARCH QUESTION]** The statutory history and rationale for this dramatic disparity requires investigation.

**Recommendation:** Research legislative history of 32 M.R.S. Chapter 36-A CME provisions to understand:
- When 100-hour requirement was established
- Legislative intent and testimony
- Whether 100 hours has always been required or increased over time
- Comparison to MD board hour evolution
- Osteopathic profession advocacy role in statute

### Other State-Specific Requirements

**[CRITICAL GAP]** Beyond osteopathic education minimum and opioid CME, other Maine-specific requirements for DOs are unknown and require research.

**Potential Additional Requirements (require verification):**
- Jurisprudence examination
- Maine-specific medical laws training
- State board regulation reading (like MD board's 2-credit requirement)
- Medical marijuana education
- Other health care provider rights/responsibilities

**Recommendation:** Research 32 M.R.S. Chapter 36-A comprehensively and contact board to identify all state-specific DO requirements.

### Key Differences Requiring Special Attention

#### 1. TOTAL CME HOURS: 2.5x Disparity (Largest in United States)

**[FACT - DRAMATIC DISPARITY]**
- **MD:** 50 credits/2yr
- **DO:** 100 hours/2yr
- **Difference:** +50 hours (150% increase for DOs)

**Impact Analysis:**

**Time Burden:**
- DOs must complete 50 additional hours per biennium
- At average 1 hour CME activity = 1 credit, DOs spend 50 more hours in CME
- Over 10-year career: 250 additional hours for DOs (6.25 work weeks)

**Financial Burden:**
- Category 1 CME average cost: $50-150 per hour
- Additional 50 hours = $2,500-7,500 additional cost per biennium
- Over 10-year career: $12,500-37,500 additional expense for DOs

**Compliance Risk:**
- Higher total requirement = higher risk of non-compliance
- More CME activities to track and document
- Greater administrative burden

**National Comparison:**
- **NO OTHER SPLIT-BOARD STATE** has this magnitude of disparity
- Most split-board states have identical hours for MD/DO
- Florida has minimal 2-hour difference (DO 40, MD 38)
- Pennsylvania has identical hours (both 100/2yr)
- Maine is unprecedented outlier

**[CRITICAL RESEARCH QUESTION]** Why does Maine impose 2.5x more CME on DOs?

**Possible Explanations (require statutory research):**

1. **Historical Statutory Evolution:**
   - Chapter 36 (MD) and Chapter 36-A (DO) evolved independently
   - Different legislative bills/amendments over time
   - No coordination between boards on CME standards

2. **Osteopathic Education Driver:**
   - 40-hour osteopathic education minimum + 60 hours general = 100 hours
   - MD board no osteopathic education requirement = 50 hours sufficient
   - Different educational philosophy driving total requirement

3. **National Osteopathic Standards:**
   - AOA recommendations may drive DO board higher
   - DO board alignment with national osteopathic CME standards
   - MD board independent from AMA recommendations

4. **Board Philosophy Differences:**
   - DO board emphasis on continuing competency differs from MD board
   - Different interpretations of "adequate" CME
   - Historical board composition and leadership priorities

**Recommendation:** Research legislative history of CME requirements in both Chapter 36 and 36-A to understand disparity origin and rationale.

#### 2. Osteopathic Education Requirement (DO-Specific)

**[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE]**
- **MD:** No osteopathic education requirement (N/A)
- **DO:** 40 hours minimum osteopathic education (40% of total)

**Impact:**
- DOs must ensure substantial portion of CME is osteopathic-focused
- Limits flexibility in CME selection
- Requires access to AOA-accredited or osteopathic-focused CME
- May increase cost if osteopathic CME less available than general CME

**Comparison to Other States:**
- Arizona DO: 24 hours AOA Category 1-A minimum (60% osteopathic focus)
- California DO: 20 hours AOA Category 1-A/1-B minimum (40% osteopathic)
- Florida DO: 20 hours AOA Category 1-A minimum (50% osteopathic)
- Pennsylvania DO: 20 hours AOA Category 1-A minimum (20% osteopathic)

**Maine Context:**
- Maine DO: 40 hours osteopathic minimum (40% osteopathic)
- **HIGHER absolute hours** than most states (40 vs 20-24)
- **Similar percentage** to California and Florida (40%)

**[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE]** Maine's 40-hour osteopathic requirement is higher in absolute hours than most states but proportionally similar when considering total requirement (40% of 100 hours).

#### 3. Category Structure Differences

**MD Board:**
- Category 1 or 2 acceptable
- No practice-type differentiation
- Pilot program flexibility
- AMA category structure

**DO Board:**
- ALL Category 1 only (no Category 2)
- Primary care vs specialist differentiation
- Primary care: AOA Category 1 only
- Specialist: AOA/ACGME/AMA Category 1
- More restrictive than MD board

**Impact:**
- DOs cannot use Category 2 CME (self-study, journal reading, etc.)
- Primary care DOs must use AOA-accredited providers exclusively
- Specialist DOs have more flexibility but still Category 1 only
- Higher cost for DOs (Category 1 typically more expensive)

#### 4. Mandatory Topic Differences (Unknown for DO Board)

**[CRITICAL GAP]** MD board has extensive mandatory topic requirements (Risk Management, Implicit Bias, Child Abuse, Domestic Violence, End-of-Life, Alzheimer's, EHR, Board Regulations). Whether DO board has parallel, different, or no additional requirements is completely unknown.

**Possible Scenarios:**

**Scenario A: DO board has NO additional mandatory topics**
- Only opioid CME required
- Osteopathic education requirement substitutes for topic-specific requirements
- Simpler compliance than MD board

**Scenario B: DO board has PARALLEL mandatory topics**
- Same or similar topics as MD board
- Adds to 100-hour burden
- More complex compliance

**Scenario C: DO board has UNIQUE osteopathic topics**
- Osteopathic-specific mandatory topics (OMT, OPP, etc.)
- Different from MD requirements
- Separate compliance tracking needed

**Recommendation:** Research 32 M.R.S. Chapter 36-A and contact board to determine all mandatory topic requirements for DOs.

### National Split-Board State Comparison

**Maine in Context of All US Split-Board States:**

| State | MD Hrs/Cycle | DO Hrs/Cycle | Ratio | Maine Comparison |
|-------|--------------|--------------|-------|------------------|
| **Maine** | **50/2yr** | **100/2yr** | **2.5x** | **LARGEST disparity** |
| Arizona | 40/2yr | 40/2yr | 1.0x | Maine DO same total, MD 1.25x less |
| California | 50/2yr | 50/2yr | 1.0x | Maine MD same, DO 2x more |
| Florida | 38/2yr | 40/2yr | 1.05x | Minimal difference, Maine dramatic |
| Michigan | 150/3yr (50/yr) | 150/3yr (50/yr) | 1.0x | Same hours, Maine DO 2x more/yr |
| Nevada | 40/2yr | 40/yr | 2.0x | DO annual vs biennial, different structure |
| Oklahoma | 60/3yr (20/yr) | 16/yr | 0.8x | OK DO less than MD, Maine opposite |
| Pennsylvania | 100/2yr | 100/2yr | 1.0x | Same hours, Maine MD half |
| Tennessee | 40/2yr | 40/2yr | 1.0x | Same hours, Maine DO 2.5x more |
| Vermont | 30/2yr | 30/2yr | 1.0x | Same hours, Maine DO 3.3x more |
| Washington | 200/4yr (50/yr) | 150/3yr (50/yr) | 1.0x | Same annual rate, Maine DO 2x more |
| West Virginia | 50/2yr | 32/2yr | 0.64x | WV DO less, Maine DO 3.1x more |

**Key Observations:**

1. **Maine is ONLY state where DO requirement is 2x+ higher than MD**
   - All other states: identical or minimal difference
   - Nevada has different cycle structure but similar annual rate
   - Oklahoma and West Virginia have DO slightly less than MD

2. **Maine DO requirement is among HIGHEST in absolute hours**
   - Tied with Pennsylvania DO (both 100/2yr)
   - Exceeded only by Washington (effective 50/yr but in 3-yr cycle)
   - Higher than most states' MD or DO requirements

3. **Maine MD requirement is MIDDLE-OF-PACK**
   - 50/2yr is common (California MD, Washington effective rate, WV MD)
   - Not exceptionally high or low
   - **The disparity is driven by DO requirement being exceptionally high, not MD being low**

**[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE]** Maine's dramatic MD/DO disparity is anomalous and unprecedented among US split-board states. The 2.5x difference appears to result from:
- DO board setting exceptionally high total requirement (100/2yr)
- MD board having standard mid-range requirement (50/2yr)
- Separate statutory frameworks evolving independently
- Lack of coordination between boards on CME standards

- MD board website reviewed but DO board not linked

**Verification Methods:**
1. Contact Maine DHHS at (207) 287-3601 (MD board number) for DO board contact
2. Search Maine state government directory for "Board of Osteopathic Licensure"
3. Review 32 M.R.S. Chapter 36-A for board contact information in statute
4. Contact Maine Legislature library for board information

**Priority:** **CRITICAL** - Blocks all other verification

---

#### GAP ME-DO-002: Total CME Hours (100 hrs/2yr Verification)
**Description:** The 100 hours/2yr total CME requirement is based on tracker notes and FSMB data but not verified against primary statute or board regulations.

**Impact:** Cannot confirm compliance threshold for DO physicians. Incorrect hour total would cause systemic compliance errors.

**What We Know:**
- **[FACT - TRACKER]** State research tracker notes: "100 hrs/2yr"
- **[FACT - FSMB]** FSMB database lists Maine DO requirement (via tracker reference)
- **[INFERENCE]** 2.5x more than MD board (50 credits/2yr)

**What We Don't Know:**
- Specific statute section establishing 100-hour requirement

## 15. Appendix: Uncovered Topics & Additional Context

### Topics Researched But Not Included (Out-of-Scope)

The following topics were considered but fall outside renewal requirement scope:

#### Initial Licensing Requirements (COMLEX, Medical School)

**Status:** Out-of-scope (covered in initial licensing rubric)

**Finding:** DO initial licensure requires:
- COMLEX (Comprehensive Osteopathic Medical Licensing Examination) - not applicable to renewal
- Graduation from AOA or COCA-accredited osteopathic medical school - not applicable to renewal
- Postgraduate training - may affect renewal if credit given for residency

**Relevance to Renewal:** Only relevant if residency/fellowship training provides CME credit toward renewal (GAP ME-DO-016)

#### Disciplinary Procedures & Board Actions

**Status:** Out-of-scope (separate from CME non-compliance)

**Finding:** Board has authority to discipline for various violations including CME non-compliance, but disciplinary procedures are separate topic

**Relevance to Renewal:** CME non-compliance may trigger discipline, but full disciplinary process out-of-scope

#### Prescribing Authority & Scope of Practice

**Status:** Out-of-scope (not a renewal requirement)

**Finding:** DO scope of practice includes full prescribing authority in Maine, same as MDs

**Relevance to Renewal:** Only relevant for opioid CME requirement applicability (conditional on prescribing)

### Additional Information Discovered (For Future Consideration)

#### Split-Board State Comparative Analysis Value

**Discovery:** Maine's 2.5x MD/DO disparity is unprecedented and may warrant deeper research for policy implications.

**Relevance:** Understanding why Maine has this disparity could inform:
- Potential future legislative changes
- Advocacy efforts by osteopathic physicians
- National policy discussions on CME harmonization
- Academic research on medical board regulatory approaches

**Recommendation:** Consider comprehensive legislative history research and policy analysis as separate project beyond compliance-focused rules engine needs.

#### Osteopathic Education CME Market Analysis

**Discovery:** 40-hour osteopathic education minimum may create significant demand for AOA-accredited CME in Maine.

**Relevance:**
- CME providers may target Maine DOs
- Cost and availability of osteopathic CME affects compliance burden
- Maine DOs may need guidance on finding qualifying CME

**Recommendation:** Consider creating resource guide for Maine DOs listing AOA-accredited CME providers, osteopathic conferences, and online osteopathic CME sources (separate from rules engine, value-add service).

#### Primary Care vs. Specialist Designation Implications

**Discovery:** Category requirement differentiation based on practice type is unusual.

**Relevance:**
- May affect career decisions (primary care vs. specialty practice)
- DOs switching practice types need guidance on category transitions
- Verification of designation may be complex

**Recommendation:** Once designation criteria verified, consider developing guidance document for DOs on how to classify practice and plan CME accordingly.

#### National Osteopathic CME Tracking Integration

**Discovery:** Maine DO board may integrate with AOA national CME database.

**Relevance:**
- Could simplify compliance for DOs using AOA CME
- Integration status affects CME tracking recommendations
- May reduce documentation burden if auto-reporting enabled

**Recommendation:** Verify AOA integration status and document in future version if confirmed (GAP ME-DO-006 related).

## Conclusion

### Summary of Findings

Maine's DO license renewal requirements represent a unique and complex regulatory framework characterized by:

1. **DRAMATIC MD/DO DISPARITY:** 100 hours/2yr for DOs vs. 50 credits/2yr for MDs (2.5x difference) - the LARGEST among all US split-board states

2. **OSTEOPATHIC EDUCATION MINIMUM:** 40 hours (40% of total) must be osteopathic education - definition and qualifying criteria require verification

3. **PRACTICE-TYPE DIFFERENTIATION:** Primary care DOs restricted to AOA Category 1; specialists may use AOA/ACGME/AMA Category 1 - designation criteria unknown

4. **OPIOID CME REQUIREMENT:** 3 hours opioid medication education - frequency and integration with total hours requires verification

5. **SPLIT-BOARD COMPLEXITY:** Completely separate boards (MD Chapter 36, DO Chapter 36-A) with independent statutory frameworks and no apparent coordination on CME standards

### For DO Physician Compliance (Based on Current Knowledge)

**PRELIMINARY GUIDANCE** (pending verification):

**Total Requirement:**
- Complete 100 hours of CME every 2 years
- Ensure 40 hours minimum qualify as osteopathic education
- Ensure all CME is Category 1 (no Category 2)

**Category Selection:**
- **If Primary Care DO:** Use only AOA Category 1 CME
- **If Specialist DO:** May use AOA, ACGME, or AMA Category 1 CME
- **Verify designation criteria with board** (GAP ME-DO-004)

**Mandatory Topics:**
- Complete 3 hours opioid medication prescribing education
- **Verify if other mandatory topics apply** (GAP ME-DO-014)

**Documentation:**
- Maintain CME certificates for all activities
- Ensure osteopathic CME clearly identified (provider, accreditation)
- **Verify retention period with board** (GAP ME-DO-013)

**Tracking:**
- **Contact board to identify CME tracking system** (GAP ME-DO-006)
- Maintain personal CME log as backup

**Timeline:**
- **Verify renewal dates with board** (GAP ME-DO-005)
- Begin CME immediately (high hour requirement)

**CRITICAL:** This preliminary guidance is based on 55% complete research. DOs MUST contact board to verify all requirements before relying on this guidance for compliance.

### For Rules Engine Implementation

**Maine DO requirements CANNOT be implemented in rules engine until CRITICAL GAPS resolved:**

**Blocking Gaps:**
- Total hours verification (GAP ME-DO-002)
- Osteopathic education definition (GAP ME-DO-003)
- Primary care/specialist designation criteria (GAP ME-DO-004)
- Renewal cycle dates (GAP ME-DO-005)
- CME tracking system (GAP ME-DO-006)

**Rules Engine Considerations:**
- Separate DO tracking from MD (completely different requirements)
- Implement 100-hour total threshold (pending verification)
- Implement 40-hour osteopathic education minimum (pending definition)
- Implement practice-type designation logic (pending criteria)
- Implement primary care vs specialist category validation
- Track 2.5x MD/DO disparity for split-board state reporting
- Flag LARGEST disparity in US for compliance risk assessment

**Estimated Development Complexity:** HIGH
- Multiple conditional logic branches (primary care vs specialist)
- Osteopathic education sub-requirement tracking
- 2.5x hour burden requires robust tracking
- Definition-dependent compliance validation

**Implementation Blockers:** 6 CRITICAL gaps must be resolved first

---

**TIER 2 SPLIT-BOARD STATUS CONFIRMED:** Maine requires separate MD and DO research documents due to DRAMATIC 2.5x CME hour disparity (LARGEST in United States), osteopathic education minimum requirement, and practice-type differentiation. This DO document provides PRELIMINARY foundation (55% complete) but requires significant additional research to achieve deployment-ready 85%+ standard.
