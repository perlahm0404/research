- **DEA Certificate Holders:** Additional 5 hours controlled substance prescribing education
- **Renewal Cycle:** Biennial (every 2 years)
- **Renewal Deadline:** [To be verified]
- **Board Certification:** [Exemption status to be verified]
- **Audit Rate:** [To be verified]

---

## 1. Board Information & Regulatory Authority

### Official Board Information

[FACT - BOARD] The Mississippi State Board of Medical Licensure (MSBML) is the official regulatory agency for allopathic physicians in Mississippi. Website: https://www.msbml.ms.gov/. Phone: (601) 987-3079. (Accessed 2026-01-02)

[FACT - STATUTE] The Mississippi State Board of Medical Licensure's authority derives from Mississippi Code Title 73, Chapter 25 (Physicians and Surgeons).

### Primary Statutory Framework

[FACT - STATUTE] Mississippi Code Title 73, Chapter 25 establishes the statutory foundation for medical licensure and continuing education in Mississippi.

[FACT - ADMIN_CODE] Mississippi Administrative Code Title 30, Part 2505 provides detailed regulations for medical licensing and CME requirements.

[FACT - STATUTE] Mississippi Code 73-25-29 specifically addresses continuing medical education requirements for physicians.

[FACT - BOARD] Mississippi operates a unified board structure for MD and DO physicians (Mississippi State Board of Medical Licensure regulates both).

---

## 2. Renewal Cycle & Dates

### Biennial Renewal Schedule

[FACT - STATUTE] Mississippi physicians renew their medical licenses every 2 years (biennial renewal cycle).

[CRITICAL GAP] Specific renewal deadline dates (e.g., birth month, December 31, license issue date) are not documented in available materials.

**Common Biennial Renewal Patterns:**
- Birth month-based (staggered throughout year)
- Fixed date (e.g., December 31 for all physicians)
- License issue anniversary date

[RECOMMENDATION] Contact the Mississippi State Board of Medical Licensure to clarify biennial renewal deadline structure.

### Renewal Timeline & Submission Windows

[CRITICAL GAP] The exact timeline for when physicians may begin renewal before expiration, notification procedures, and submission windows are not documented in available research materials.

### Grace Period & Late Renewal

[CRITICAL GAP] Grace period mechanics, late fees, and consequences of missed renewal deadlines are not documented in available materials.

---

## 3. CME Requirements - Base Hours & Categories

### Total CME Hours Required

[FACT - STATUTE] Mississippi requires 40 hours of continuing medical education every 2 years (biennial cycle).

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] This is a standard biennial requirement comparable to many other states (e.g., Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Iowa, North Dakota).

**Comparison to Other States:**
- Mississippi: 40 hours/2 years
- Georgia: 40 hours/2 years
- Iowa: 40 hours/2 years
- Hawaii: 40 hours/2 years
- Idaho: 40 hours/2 years

Mississippi's requirement is STANDARD among biennial states.

### Category 1 Requirement

[FACT - STATUTE] All 40 hours of Mississippi CME must be **AMA PRA Category 1** credit.

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] This means:
- NO Category 2 credit accepted
- NO informal CME accepted
- Only formal, accredited CME from AMA-approved providers
- Higher quality standard than states allowing mixed Category 1/Category 2

[CRITICAL - STRICT REQUIREMENT] Mississippi's "all Category 1" requirement is stricter than states allowing informal CME or Category 2 credit (e.g., Texas allows 24 hours informal). Physicians must ensure all CME is formally accredited.

### CME Provider Accreditation

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] Acceptable CME providers for Category 1 credit include:
- ACCME (Accreditation Council for Continuing Medical Education)
- State medical societies with ACCME accreditation
- Specialty societies with ACCME accreditation
- Medical schools and academic institutions with ACCME accreditation
- AOA Category 1-A (for DO-provided CME that meets AMA Category 1 standards, if accepted)

[CRITICAL GAP] Whether AOA Category 1-A credit is acceptable for MDs in Mississippi (since board regulates both MD and DO) is not documented.

### No Carryover Provisions

[CRITICAL - NOTABLE ABSENCE] Research found NO carryover provisions in Mississippi. Unlike Iowa (20-hour carryover) or Nebraska (25-hour carryover), Mississippi does not allow excess CME hours from one cycle to carry forward to the next.

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] This simplifies tracking (no need to track excess hours from previous cycles) but reduces flexibility for physicians who complete variable CME amounts year-to-year.

---

## 4. CME Topic Requirements - Mandatory Topics

### Overview of Mandatory Topics

[FACT - STATUTE] Mississippi has ONE mandatory CME topic: 5 hours of controlled substance prescribing education for DEA certificate holders.

### Topic 1: Controlled Substance Prescribing (5 hours, DEA certificate holders, MANDATORY)

[FACT - STATUTE] Physicians who hold a **DEA certificate** (Drug Enforcement Administration registration for controlled substance prescribing) must complete **5 hours of CME on controlled substance prescribing** as part of their 40-hour biennial requirement.

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] This requirement:
- Applies ONLY to DEA certificate holders
- Does NOT apply to physicians without DEA registration
- Is counted WITHIN the 40-hour requirement (not in addition to)
- Must be completed every 2-year renewal cycle (not one-time)

**Key Characteristics:**
- **Hours:** 5 hours
- **Frequency:** Every 2 years (each biennial renewal)
- **Applicability:** DEA certificate holders only
- **Integration:** Counts toward the 40-hour total requirement

[CRITICAL GAP] Specific content requirements for the 5-hour controlled substance prescribing CME:
- What topics must be covered (opioid prescribing, pain management, addiction, diversion, PDMP)?
- Which course providers are acceptable?
- Must the 5 hours be from a single course or can it be distributed across multiple courses?

[RECOMMENDATION] Contact MSBML to clarify:
1. Specific content topics for controlled substance prescribing CME
2. Acceptable course providers
3. Whether 5 hours must be from single course or can be distributed

### No Other Mandatory Topics Found

[FACT - STATUTE] Research identified no other mandatory CME topics beyond the 5-hour controlled substance prescribing requirement for DEA holders.

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] Unlike many states with multiple mandatory topics (e.g., Illinois with sexual harassment, implicit bias, opioids, cultural competency, dementia), Mississippi has a simple structure with only one conditional mandatory topic.

**Comparison to Other States:**
- Mississippi: 1 mandatory topic (5 hrs controlled substances, DEA only)
- Illinois: 5+ mandatory topics across 3-year and 6-year cycles
- Texas: 3+ mandatory topics (pain management, ethics, human trafficking)
- Louisiana: 1 specialty-specific mandatory topic (nutrition for FM/IM/peds/OB)

Mississippi's minimal mandatory topic structure contributes to its TIER 1 (simple) classification.

---

## 5. Specialty-Specific CME Requirements

### No Specialty-Specific Requirements Found

[FACT - STATUTE] Research identified no specialty-specific CME requirements beyond the general 40-hour biennial requirement and the 5-hour controlled substance prescribing requirement for DEA holders (which is not specialty-specific, but registration-specific).

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] Mississippi does not impose additional CME burdens on specific specialties (e.g., pain management clinics, OB/GYN, emergency medicine) beyond the base 40-hour requirement.

---

## 6. Exemptions & Special Circumstances

### Board Certification Exemption

[CRITICAL GAP] Whether Mississippi provides exemptions or reductions in CME requirements for physicians holding ABMS or AOA board certification is not documented in available materials.

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] Based on other states' practices, Mississippi may:
- Provide full exemption if board certified within a specific timeframe
- Provide partial credit for MOC activities
- Require full CME regardless of board certification status

[RECOMMENDATION] Contact MSBML to clarify board certification treatment.

### New Licensee Exemption

[CRITICAL GAP] Whether newly licensed physicians are exempt from the 40-hour CME requirement for their first renewal is not documented.

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] Many states exempt new licensees from CME for their first renewal. Mississippi may follow this pattern, but verification is needed.

### DEA Certificate Exemption from 5-Hour Requirement

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] The 5-hour controlled substance prescribing requirement applies to DEA certificate holders. Physicians without DEA registration are exempt from this requirement (but must still complete 40 hours total CME).

### Other Exemptions

[CRITICAL GAP] Whether exemptions exist for:
- Retired physicians
- Inactive licenses
- Military service
- Hardship circumstances
- Resident physicians

These are not documented in available materials.

---

## 7. Regulatory Timeline & Effective Dates

### Current Requirements Status

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] The 40-hour biennial requirement and 5-hour controlled substance prescribing requirement for DEA holders are currently in effect based on FSMB data.

[CRITICAL GAP] The specific effective dates for these requirements are not documented in available materials.

**Timeline of Mississippi MD CME Regulatory Changes:**

| Date | Requirement | Status | Reference |
|------|-------------|--------|-----------|
| [Date TBD] | 40 hours/2yr, all Category 1 | EFFECTIVE (baseline) | MS Code 73-25-29 |
| [Date TBD] | 5 hours controlled substance (DEA holders) | EFFECTIVE | MAC 30-2505 |

[RECOMMENDATION] Research Mississippi Code 73-25-29 and Mississippi Administrative Code 30-2505 directly to obtain effective dates and historical context.

---

## 8. Controlled Substance & DEA Requirements

### State Controlled Substance Prescribing Requirement

[FACT - STATUTE] Mississippi requires DEA certificate holders to complete 5 hours of controlled substance prescribing CME every 2 years (see Section 4, Topic 1).

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] This requirement addresses:
- Opioid prescribing guidelines
- Pain management best practices
- Addiction and substance use disorder recognition
- Prescription drug monitoring program (PDMP) use
- Controlled substance diversion prevention

### Federal DEA MATE Act Requirement (Separate from Mississippi State CME)

[FACT - STATUTE] The federal Medication Access and Training Expansion (MATE) Act (effective June 27, 2023) requires physicians applying for or renewing DEA registration to attest they have completed 8 hours of training on opioid or other substance use disorders.

[FACT - STATUTE] The MATE Act requirement is:
- One-time for newly registering physicians (after June 27, 2023)
- Required at DEA registration renewal for continuing registrants
- Separate from Mississippi state CME requirements
- Available as free attestation for recent medical school graduates (graduated within 5 years of June 27, 2023)

[CRITICAL - DUAL REQUIREMENTS] DEA-registered physicians in Mississippi face TWO separate opioid/controlled substance training requirements:
1. **State requirement:** 5 hours controlled substance prescribing CME every 2 years (counts toward 40-hour requirement)
2. **Federal requirement:** 8 hours MATE Act training (one-time or at DEA renewal, separate from state CME)

[CRITICAL GAP] Whether Mississippi's 5-hour state requirement can count toward the federal 8-hour MATE Act requirement, or if these must be separate courses, is not documented.

[RECOMMENDATION] Clarify with MSBML and DEA:
1. Can the 5-hour state requirement satisfy part of the 8-hour federal MATE Act requirement?
2. Must these be separate courses with distinct content?
3. What is the relationship between state and federal controlled substance CME requirements?

---

## 9. CME Tracking & Compliance Verification

### Documentation Requirements

[CRITICAL GAP] Specific documentation requirements (certificates, transcripts, self-attestation, etc.) are not documented in available materials.

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] Based on typical state practice, physicians likely must:
- Maintain certificates of completion for all CME
- Provide documentation upon request or during audit
- Retain records for a specified period (e.g., 5-7 years)
- Verify Category 1 accreditation for all courses

### Audit Procedures

[CRITICAL GAP] Whether the Mississippi State Board of Medical Licensure conducts audits of CME compliance, and if so, the frequency and procedures, is not documented in available materials.

[RECOMMENDATION] Contact MSBML to clarify audit procedures and documentation retention requirements.

---

## 10. Renewal Procedures & Fees

### Standard Renewal Process

[FACT - BOARD] Mississippi physicians renew through the Mississippi State Board of Medical Licensure online portal (exact URL to be verified).

[CRITICAL GAP] The exact renewal portal URL, submission procedures, and renewal window details are not documented in available materials beyond the general board website.

### Renewal Fees

[CRITICAL GAP] The specific biennial renewal fee amount for Mississippi medical licenses is not documented in available research materials.

### Grace Period & Late Renewal

[CRITICAL GAP] Grace period mechanics, late fees, and consequences of expired licenses are not documented in available materials.

---

## 11. Comparison to Other TIER 1 States

### Mississippi vs. Other Simple Biennial States

**Mississippi:** 40 hours/2yr, all Category 1, 5 hrs controlled substance (DEA holders)

**Similar TIER 1 States:**
- **Georgia:** 40 hours/2yr, 25% Category 1, 3 hrs opioid (DEA holders, one-time)
- **Idaho:** 40 hours/2yr, all Category 1, board cert exemption available
- **Iowa:** 40 hours/2yr, up to 20 hrs carryover, multiple 3-year and 5-year topics
- **Hawaii:** 40 hours/2yr, all Category 1 or 1-A, no mandatory topics documented

**Key Differences:**
- Mississippi requires ALL Category 1 (stricter than Georgia's 25% minimum)
- Mississippi has NO carryover (simpler than Iowa's 20-hour carryover)
- Mississippi has ONE mandatory topic (simpler than Iowa's multiple topics)
- Mississippi's 5-hour DEA requirement is recurring (vs. Georgia's one-time 3-hour requirement)

**Mississippi's Position:** Mississippi is among the simplest biennial states with a clear 40-hour all-Category-1 requirement and minimal mandatory topics. The lack of carryover provisions and board certification exemptions further simplifies compliance tracking.

## Conclusion

Mississippi MD license renewal requirements are **simple and straightforward** (TIER 1) with a clear biennial structure and minimal mandatory topics.

**Core Requirements Summary:**
- 40 hours CME every 2 years, all AMA PRA Category 1
- DEA certificate holders: Additional 5 hours controlled substance prescribing CME (counted within 40-hour total)
- Biennial renewal cycle
- No carryover provisions
- No board certification exemptions documented

**Key Simplicity Factors:**
1. Clear 40-hour biennial requirement (standard among states)
2. All Category 1 requirement (clear quality standard, no mixed categories)
3. Single conditional mandatory topic (5 hours controlled substances for DEA holders only)
4. No carryover complexity (no need to track excess hours from previous cycles)
5. No complex sub-cycles or multiple mandatory topics
6. No board certification alternatives documented

**For Physician Compliance:** Complete 40 hours AMA PRA Category 1 CME every 2 years. DEA certificate holders: ensure 5 of the 40 hours address controlled substance prescribing. Track federal MATE Act requirement separately (8 hours, one-time or at DEA renewal). Verify biennial renewal deadline with board.

**For Rules Engine Implementation:** Implementation is straightforward. Track 40-hour biennial requirement with Category 1 validation. For DEA holders, track 5-hour controlled substance prescribing sub-requirement (within 40 hours). No carryover logic needed. Federal MATE Act requirement should be tracked separately from state CME.

**Critical Next Steps:**
1. Contact Mississippi State Board of Medical Licensure at (601) 987-3079 to clarify:
   - Biennial renewal deadline structure and dates
   - Controlled substance CME content requirements and acceptable courses
   - Board certification exemption status
   - New licensee exemption
   - Relationship between state 5-hour and federal 8-hour requirements
   - Renewal fees, grace period, and procedures
   - Audit and documentation requirements
