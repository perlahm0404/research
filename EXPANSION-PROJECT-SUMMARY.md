# TIER-1 Expansion Project - Executive Summary
**Date:** 2026-01-02
**Status:** Ready to Begin
**Total Effort:** ~99 hours over 4 weeks

---

## 📋 PROJECT OVERVIEW

### What We're Doing

Expanding incomplete TIER-1 state documents from current **C grade (66-71%)** to **B+/A- standard (85%+)**, then completing remaining TIER-1 states to the same standard.

### Why This Matters

1. **Quality Consistency:** Current documents vary 4x in length despite similar completion %
2. **Rules Engine Readiness:** Missing sections (audit, tracking, reinstatement) needed for full functionality
3. **User Trust:** Comprehensive documentation establishes credibility
4. **Scalability:** Sets quality baseline for TIER-2/TIER-3 research

## 📊 CURRENT STATE ASSESSMENT

### Documents Requiring Expansion (Phase 1)

| State | Current Lines | Current % | Target Lines | Target % | Priority |
|-------|---------------|-----------|--------------|----------|----------|
| **KY** | 160 | 71% | 450-500 | 85% | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Highest (best foundation) |
| **GA** | 153 | 68% | 450-500 | 85% | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ High (pain clinics critical) |
| **ID** | 149 | 68% | 450-500 | 85% | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ High (board cert excellent) |
| **HI** | 153 | 67% | 450-500 | 85% | ⭐⭐⭐ High (unique category rule) |
| **KS** | 143 | 66% | 450-500 | 85% | ⭐⭐⭐ High (flexible cycles) |

**Phase 1 Total:** 25 hours (5 states × 5 hours each)

### States Needing Full Research (Phase 2)

10 TIER-1 states still pending: MS, NH, RI, MO, NE, OH, OR, UT, SC, WI

**Phase 2 Total:** 68-88 hours (10 states × 7-9 hours each)

## 📁 DOCUMENTS CREATED

### 1. Audit Report (47 pages)
**File:** [AUDIT-REPORT-TIER-1-Research-2026-01-02.md](AUDIT-REPORT-TIER-1-Research-2026-01-02.md)

**Key Findings:**
- 4.1x variance in document length (153 vs 634 lines)
- Evidence citations vary 5.8x (16 vs 93)
- All short documents missing same 4 sections
- Core requirements captured (good for MVP)
- Quality variance creates credibility risk

**Recommendations:**
- Recalibrate completion percentages
- Add minimum requirements to prompt
- Expand short documents to 85% standard
- Establish quality baseline for TIER-2/3

### 2. Expansion Plan (35 pages)
**File:** [TIER-1-EXPANSION-PLAN.md](TIER-1-EXPANSION-PLAN.md)

**Contents:**
- Phase 1: Expand 5 incomplete states (25 hours)
- Phase 2: Complete 10 remaining states (68-88 hours)
- Section-by-section research templates
- Search strategies for missing content
- Quality control checklist
- 4-week timeline with milestones

### 3. Implementation Guide (30 pages)
**File:** [START-HERE-Expansion-Guide.md](START-HERE-Expansion-Guide.md)

**Contents:**
- Step-by-step Kentucky expansion (pilot state)
- 6 detailed research tasks with search strategies
- Expected output templates for each section
- Quality checklist
- Time tracking template
- Git commit guidance

## 🚀 HOW TO START

### Option 1: Pilot with Kentucky (Recommended)

**Why Kentucky?**
- Best existing foundation (160 lines, 71%)
- Grace period already documented
- Penalty structure already clear
- Estimate: 5 hours to reach 85%

**Steps:**
1. Open: [START-HERE-Expansion-Guide.md](START-HERE-Expansion-Guide.md)
2. Follow Tasks 1-6 (research missing sections)
3. Write expansion content
4. Quality check (450 lines, 50 citations)
5. Update tracker CSV
6. Git commit

**Expected Outcome:**
- Kentucky document: 500+ lines, 85%, version 3.0
- Proves expansion process works
- Template for remaining 4 states

### Option 2: Batch Process All 5 States

**Approach:**
- Research all 5 states in parallel (Audit → Tracking → Reinstatement)
- Write expansions in batch
- Quality check all together

**Pros:** More efficient, consistent approach
**Cons:** Slower to see first complete result, higher risk if process has issues

### Option 3: Complete Remaining States First

**Approach:**
- Start with simplest pending states (MS, NH, RI)
- Use updated prompt with minimum requirements
- Return to expand incomplete states later

**Pros:** Breadth over depth, more states complete faster
**Cons:** Quality variance remains, doesn't address root issue

- ✅ NEVER guess at requirements
- ✅ Document 3+ search attempts for gaps
- ✅ Mark uncertainty with [INFERENCE] and confidence level
- ✅ Cite sources with URLs and access dates

### Evidence Classification
- **[FACT - STATUTE]:** Direct from state law (quote + cite + URL)
- **[FACT - ADMIN_CODE]:** From administrative regulations (quote + cite + URL)
- **[FACT - BOARD]:** From official board website (URL + date)
- **[INFERENCE - CONFIDENCE]:** Derived from facts (reasoning + confidence)
- **[CRITICAL GAP]:** Not found after extensive search (3+ attempts + impact)

### Completion Percentage Calibration
- **50%:** Stub (150 lines, 15 citations, 7 sections)
- **70%:** Standard (300 lines, 25 citations, 10 sections)
- **85%:** Comprehensive (450 lines, 50 citations, 13-15 sections) ← TARGET
- **95%:** Reference-quality (600 lines, 75 citations, 15 sections)

## 📧 QUESTIONS?

If you encounter issues:

1. **Can't find information?** → Document 3+ search attempts, mark as [CRITICAL GAP]
2. **Conflicting sources?** → Note in cross-source validation, prioritize statute
3. **Uncertain about requirement?** → Use [INFERENCE] with reasoning and confidence
4. **Time running over?** → Acceptable to hit 85% minimum, not 95% ideal
5. **Need clarification?** → Review relevant section in expansion plan or pilot guide
