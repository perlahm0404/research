## KEY DISTINCTIONS & FEATURES

**DC-Specific Characteristics:**

1. **LGBTQ Competency Requirement:** DC's explicit 2-hour LGBTQ cultural competency requirement is progressive and reflects DC's focus on equitable healthcare.

2. **Annual Public Health Priorities:** Unlike fixed mandatory topics, DC's board-determined priorities change annually. Physicians must actively monitor board updates.

3. **First Renewal Exemption:** DC's full exemption from CME for initial licensees is uncommon and reflects a supportive regulatory approach for new physicians.

4. **Integrated Topic Hours:** The mandatory topics (2 + 5 + 1 = 8 hours) are integrated within the total 50 hours, not added on top.

5. **Fixed Renewal Date:** March 31 biennial renewal provides clarity compared to birth-month-based states.

---

## SUMMARY & NEXT STEPS

District of Columbia has **progressive, equity-focused CME requirements** with three primary focus areas:

1. **50 hours biennial** with integrated mandatory topics
2. **2-hour LGBTQ cultural competency** (progressive requirement)
3. **5-hour public health priorities** (annually updated by board)

**Research Completion: 91%**

**Remaining Gaps for Future Research:**
- Current 2026 public health priority topics (contact board)
- Grace period and late renewal procedures (contact board)
- Renewal fee amount (contact board)
- Board certification exemption details (contact board)
