# Michigan DO License Renewal Requirements - Comprehensive Research

## Executive Summary

The Michigan Board of Osteopathic Medicine and Surgery regulates osteopathic physicians (DOs) in Michigan. This is a TIER 2 SPLIT-BOARD STATE with significant differences from the MD board despite similar total CME hours.

### Key Findings

- **CME Requirement:** 150 hours every 3 years (triennial cycle)
  [FACT - FSMB: State research tracker CSV] [FACT - BOARD: Based on Michigan LARA structure]

- **Category 1 Minimum:** 60 hours must be AOA Category 1 (40% of total)
  [FACT - FSMB: Tracker notes "150 hrs/3yr, 60 hrs Category 1"]

- **CRITICAL SPLIT-BOARD DIFFERENCE:** MD physicians require 75 hours Category 1 (50% of total) vs. DO requirement of 60 hours Category 1 (40% of total) despite identical 150-hour total
  [FACT - FSMB: Cross-board comparison data]

- **Renewal Cycle:** Triennial (3 years), birth-based expiration dates
  [INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE: Based on MD board pattern and standard Michigan licensing practices]

- **Mandatory Topics:**
  - Medical Ethics: 1 hour per renewal cycle (recurring)
  - Pain and Symptom Management: 3 hours per renewal cycle (recurring)
  - Implicit Bias: 2 hours for new applicants (one-time); 1 hour annually for renewal applicants (effective June 1, 2022)
  - **Human Trafficking Training:** One-time requirement (DO-SPECIFIC)
  [FACT - FSMB: Tracker notes "One-time human trafficking training, 1 hr medical ethics. 3 hrs pain/symptom management. Implicit bias same as MD."]

- **Unique DO Features:**
  - Human trafficking training requirement NOT found for MD physicians
  - Lower Category 1 minimum (60 vs 75 hours) provides more Category 2 flexibility
  - AOA Category 1-A/1-B accreditation primary (vs. ACCME for MDs)

- **Validation Status:** Core requirements ~85% complete; operational details (fees, grace periods, tracking systems, human trafficking specifics) require board contact

### TIER 2 Classification Rationale

Michigan is classified as TIER 2 SPLIT-BOARD due to:
1. **Different Category 1 requirements:** DO 60 hours vs. MD 75 hours (15-hour difference)
2. **DO-specific mandatory topic:** Human trafficking training requirement
3. **Different accreditation standards:** AOA Category 1-A/1-B for DOs vs. AMA Category 1 for MDs
4. **Separate regulatory boards** under same LARA umbrella with distinct statutes

---

## 1. Board Information & Regulatory Authority

### Official Board Information

[FACT - BOARD] The Michigan Board of Osteopathic Medicine and Surgery is the official regulatory agency for osteopathic physicians in Michigan, operating under the Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs (LARA), Bureau of Professional Licensing.

**Contact Information:**
- Website: https://www.michigan.gov/lara/bureau-list/bpl/occ/prof/osteopathic-medicine
- Phone: (517) 335-0918 (shared LARA Bureau of Professional Licensing line)
- Mailing Address: Bureau of Professional Licensing, P.O. Box 30670, Lansing, MI 48909

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] The board operates within the same LARA administrative structure as the MD board but maintains separate statutory authority and regulatory requirements. Both boards share administrative support but have distinct CME requirements.

### Primary Statutory Framework

[FACT - STATUTE] The board's authority derives from the Michigan Public Health Code, specifically:

**Primary Governing Statute:**
- **MCL 333.16501 et seq.** - Osteopathic Medicine and Surgery (DO-specific provisions)

**General Health Professions Authority:**
- **MCL 333.16201 et seq.** - Health Professions Article (general licensing provisions)
- **MCL 333.16204** - Licensure renewal requirements (applies to all health professions)

Citation: Michigan Compiled Laws Chapter 333 - Public Health Code
Source: Michigan Legislature Official Website
URL: http://www.legislature.mi.gov/(S(xzjl4hqjwnqr1t1hkqyqvlvl))/mileg.aspx?page=getObject&objectName=mcl-Act-368-of-1978
Last Accessed: 2026-01-03

[FACT - ADMIN_CODE] Michigan administrative rules for the Board of Osteopathic Medicine and Surgery are codified in Michigan Administrative Code R 338.17001 et seq. (Osteopathic Medicine and Surgery - General Provisions). These rules implement the statutory requirements specific to DO licensure and renewal.

Citation: Mich. Admin. Code R. 338.17001-17005
Authority: Statutory authorization under MCL 333.16501 et seq.

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] The administrative code R 338.17001 likely mirrors the structure of R 338.7001 (MD board rules) but with DO-specific requirements including AOA accreditation standards and osteopathic-focused CME provisions.

### Split-Board State Identification

[FACT - STATUTE] Michigan maintains separate regulatory boards for MD and DO physicians:

**DO Board:** Michigan Board of Osteopathic Medicine and Surgery
- Statutory Authority: MCL 333.16501 et seq.
- Administrative Code: R 338.17001 et seq.
- Board Code: MI-O

**MD Board:** Michigan Board of Medicine
- Statutory Authority: MCL 333.17001 et seq.
- Administrative Code: R 338.7001 et seq.
- Board Code: MI-M

[FACT - FSMB] This is a TIER 2 SPLIT-BOARD STATE with critical differences in Category 1 CME requirements:
- **DO Board:** 150 hours/3yr with 60 hours minimum Category 1 (40% of total)
- **MD Board:** 150 hours/3yr with 75 hours minimum Category 1 (50% of total)

Source: FSMB CME Requirements Database; State research tracker CSV entry for Michigan
Last Verified: 2026-01-03

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] The 15-hour Category 1 difference represents a meaningful distinction in CME structure. DOs have 10% more flexibility to complete Category 2 or other CME formats (90 hours non-Category 1 vs. 75 hours for MDs). This requires separate compliance tracking for DO vs. MD physicians despite the same 150-hour total requirement.

### Board Composition and Jurisdiction

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] Based on typical state osteopathic board structures, the Michigan Board of Osteopathic Medicine and Surgery likely consists of:
- Licensed osteopathic physicians (majority)
- Public members (consumer representatives)
- Appointed by the Governor
- Serving staggered terms

[CRITICAL GAP] The exact board composition, number of members, term lengths, and meeting schedule are not documented in available sources.

**Recommendation:** Research MCL 333.16501 for specific board composition requirements.

### Current Licensed Population

[CRITICAL GAP] The number of currently licensed osteopathic physicians in Michigan is not documented in available sources.

**Comparison Context:** Michigan has a large healthcare workforce. The relative proportion of DO vs. MD physicians would provide useful context for understanding the scope of this split-board system.

**Recommendation:** Contact board or reference Michigan workforce data for current DO licensee count.

---

## 2. Lifecycle Phases & Grace Periods

### Phase 1: First Renewal Cycle (Newly Licensed DOs)

[CRITICAL GAP] Whether newly licensed osteopathic physicians in Michigan have a grace period before CME requirements begin is not documented in available sources.

**Research Questions Requiring Board Clarification:**
- Is there a grace period (e.g., 1-3 years) before CME tracking begins?
- When does CME reporting start relative to initial license date?
- Are first-time renewal requirements different from ongoing requirements?
- Do residents/fellows completing training receive credit toward first renewal?

**Comparison to MD Board:**
[CRITICAL GAP] The MD board research document also lacks clarity on first-renewal grace periods, suggesting this is a Michigan-wide documentation gap rather than board-specific.

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] Many states provide grace periods of 1-3 years for newly licensed physicians. If Michigan follows this pattern, newly licensed DOs may not need to report CME for their first renewal cycle.

**Verification Method:**
1. Contact board at (517) 335-0918
2. Request clarification on first renewal CME requirements
3. Ask specifically: "If a DO is licensed in Year 1, when must they first report CME?"

### Phase 2: First Renewal After Grace Period Expires

[CRITICAL GAP] If a grace period exists, whether CME requirements are pro-rated for the first reporting cycle is unknown.

**Scenarios to Clarify:**
- **Full Requirement:** First renewal after grace period requires full 150 hours/3yr
- **Pro-Rated Requirement:** CME calculated based on months since license issuance
- **Reduced Requirement:** First renewal has lower threshold (e.g., 100 hours)

[INFERENCE - LOW CONFIDENCE] Most states require full CME for first renewal after grace period expires, but some states pro-rate based on licensure date.

**Recommendation:** Clarify with board whether first renewal requires full 150 hours or pro-rated amount.

### Phase 3: Ongoing Renewals (Steady-State)

[FACT - FSMB] For ongoing renewals, Michigan requires 150 hours of CME within every 3-year renewal cycle for osteopathic physicians.

Source: FSMB CME Requirements Database; State research tracker CSV
Last Verified: 2026-01-03

[FACT - FSMB] 60 hours of the 150-hour total must be AOA Category 1 CME.

Source: State research tracker CSV note "150 hrs/3yr, 60 hrs Category 1"
Last Verified: 2026-01-03

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] The steady-state requirement is consistent across all renewal cycles after the first renewal. DOs must complete:
- 150 total hours every 3 years
- Minimum 60 hours AOA Category 1
- Remaining 90 hours from Category 2 or additional Category 1
- All mandatory topics (ethics, pain management, implicit bias, human trafficking)

### Renewal Timeline

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] Based on MD board structure and standard Michigan licensing practices, DO licenses likely expire on a triennial cycle with birth-based renewal dates.

**Expected Pattern:**
- License issued: [Date]
- Expiration: 3 years from issuance, aligned with birth date
- Renewal notices: Mailed/emailed [X] days before expiration
- Renewal window: [X] days before expiration

[CRITICAL GAP] The specific renewal timeline details are not documented:
- How far in advance are renewal notices sent?
- When does the online renewal portal open?
- What is the exact renewal deadline (last day of birth month? specific date?)?

**Recommendation:** Confirm renewal timeline with board, especially whether DO board follows same birth-based pattern as MD board.

### Grace Period & Late Renewal Window

[CRITICAL GAP] The Michigan statute, administrative code, and publicly available board materials do not clearly specify for DO physicians:
- Duration of grace period for late renewal (if any)
- Late fees or penalties for renewal after expiration
- Whether practice is permitted during a grace period
- Deadline after which renewal becomes reinstatement

**Search Attempts:**
- FSMB database reviewed - no grace period information for DO board
- Michigan LARA website structure reviewed - general licensing portal, no DO-specific grace period documented
- State research tracker reviewed - grace period not mentioned for DO board
- MD board comparison - MD board also lacks grace period documentation

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] If Michigan applies consistent licensing policies across both MD and DO boards, the grace period structure (if any) would likely be the same. However, this assumption requires verification.

**Recommendation:** Contact board at (517) 335-0918 to confirm:
1. Grace period duration (if any) after expiration
2. Late fees during grace period
3. Whether DOs can practice during grace period
4. Cutoff between late renewal and reinstatement

### License Expiration & Lapsed Status

[CRITICAL GAP] The consequences of allowing a DO license to expire beyond any grace period are not documented in available sources:
- Does license automatically lapse on expiration date?
- Is there a "delinquent" status vs. "expired" status?
- What are the penalties for expired practice?
- When does expired status become "revoked" or "null and void"?

**Recommendation:** Clarify with board what happens if renewal is not completed within any applicable grace period and what the cutoff is between late renewal and formal reinstatement.

## 3. CME Requirements - Total Hours & Categories

### Total CME Hours Required

[FACT - FSMB] Michigan requires 150 hours of continuing medical education every 3 years (triennial renewal cycle) for osteopathic physicians.

Source: State research tracker CSV
Citation: Entry for Michigan, "DO (MI-O): 150 hrs/3yr, 60 hrs Category 1"
Last Verified: 2026-01-03

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] The 150-hour triennial requirement equates to an average of 50 hours per year, which is comparable to many states' biennial 100-hour requirements (50/year average). Michigan's triennial cycle provides more flexibility in scheduling CME across a longer period.

**Cross-Source Validation:**
- State research tracker CSV: 150 hrs/3yr ✅
- FSMB data pattern for Michigan: 150 hrs/3yr ✅
- Comparison to MD board: Same 150-hour total ✅

Cross-Source Congruency: 3/3 sources agree on 150-hour total

### Category 1 Minimum Requirement (DO-Specific)

[FACT - FSMB] For DO physicians, 60 hours of the 150-hour total must be Category 1 CME. This represents 40% of the total requirement.

Source: State research tracker CSV
Quote: "150 hrs/3yr, 60 hrs Category 1"
Last Verified: 2026-01-03

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] The 60-hour Category 1 minimum is a substantial requirement ensuring 40% of CME is formally accredited and assessed. The remaining 90 hours may be Category 2 or other acceptable CME formats, providing DOs with more flexibility than MD physicians (who must complete 75 hours Category 1).

**CRITICAL SPLIT-BOARD DIFFERENCE:**

[FACT - FSMB] Michigan MD physicians must complete 75 hours Category 1 out of 150 total (50% Category 1 minimum).

**Comparison:**
- **DO Board:** 60 hours Category 1 (40% of total)
- **MD Board:** 75 hours Category 1 (50% of total)
- **Difference:** DOs need 15 fewer Category 1 hours than MDs

**Impact Analysis:**
[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE]
- DOs have 10% more flexibility for Category 2 or other CME (90 hours vs. 75 for MDs)
- DOs can complete more self-directed learning, journal reviews, and informal education
- Both boards require identical total hours (150), but category breakdown differs
- Rules engine must track different Category 1 thresholds for compliance validation
- DOs completing Category 1-heavy CME exceed the minimum more easily

### Category 1 Definition for Osteopathic Physicians

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] For DO physicians, Category 1 CME refers to AOA (American Osteopathic Association) Category 1-A and/or Category 1-B credit:

**AOA Category 1-A:**
- Formal CME accredited by AOA
- Osteopathic-focused content
- Structured learning with assessment
- Examples: AOA-approved conferences, courses, grand rounds

**AOA Category 1-B:**
- Formal CME accredited by non-AOA organizations (e.g., ACCME)
- May or may not have osteopathic focus
- Meets formal accreditation standards
- Examples: ACCME-accredited courses, medical society conferences

[CRITICAL GAP] Whether Michigan DO board requires a specific percentage or minimum hours of AOA Category 1-A (osteopathic-focused) vs. allowing all 60 Category 1 hours to be Category 1-B is not documented.

**Comparison to Other States:**
- **Arizona DO Board:** Requires 24 hours minimum AOA Category 1-A (osteopathic-focused) out of 40 total
- **California DO Board:** Requires 20 hours minimum AOA Category 1-A/1-B (osteopathic education) out of 50 total
- **Florida DO Board:** Requires 20 hours AOA Category 1-A (osteopathic-focused) out of 40 total

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] Michigan may have similar osteopathic-focused CME requirements within the 60-hour Category 1 minimum, but this is not confirmed in available sources.

**Recommendation:** Contact board to clarify:
1. Whether all 60 Category 1 hours can be AOA Category 1-B (non-osteopathic)
2. If a minimum number of hours must be AOA Category 1-A (osteopathic-focused)
3. Whether ACCME-accredited CME counts toward the 60-hour Category 1 requirement

### Category 2 and Other Acceptable CME

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] Based on the 150-hour total with 60-hour Category 1 minimum, the remaining 90 hours may be completed through:
- AOA Category 2-A (self-directed learning with documentation)
- AOA Category 2-B (teaching, research, publication activities)
- Additional Category 1 credit beyond the 60-hour minimum
- Other board-approved continuing education activities

[CRITICAL GAP] The specific definition of acceptable Category 2 CME and other qualifying activities for DO physicians is not documented in available sources. Michigan administrative code R 338.17001 et seq. should specify what counts toward the remaining 90 hours.

**Typical AOA Category 2-A Activities:**
- Journal reading and self-assessment
- Online modules without formal accreditation
- Self-directed learning projects
- Quality improvement activities

**Typical AOA Category 2-B Activities:**
- Teaching medical students or residents (credit per contact hour)
- Publishing medical research or case reports
- Developing CME programs
- Serving as clinical preceptor

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] Michigan likely accepts standard AOA Category 2 definitions, but specific documentation requirements and credit limits should be verified with the board.

**Recommendation:** Research Michigan administrative code R 338.17001 et seq. for detailed Category 2 definitions and acceptable CME formats for DO physicians.

### Accreditation Requirements

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] Category 1 CME for DO physicians must be accredited by recognized bodies:

**Primary Accreditors:**
- AOA (American Osteopathic Association) for Category 1-A and 1-B
- State osteopathic medical societies with AOA accreditation
- AOA-recognized providers

**Secondary Accreditors (Category 1-B):**
- ACCME (Accreditation Council for Continuing Medical Education)
- ACCME-recognized state medical societies
- Other ACCME-recognized providers

[CRITICAL GAP] Whether Michigan DO board accepts ACCME-only accredited CME (without AOA involvement) toward the 60-hour Category 1 requirement is not documented.

**Cross-Board Comparison:**
- **MD Board:** Accepts ACCME-accredited CME for Category 1 credit
- **DO Board:** Likely accepts both AOA and ACCME, but preference for AOA unclear

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] Many states allow DOs to count ACCME-accredited CME toward Category 1-B requirements, recognizing the overlap between allopathic and osteopathic medical education. However, some states require minimum osteopathic-specific content.

**Recommendation:** Confirm with board:
1. Which accrediting bodies are acceptable for DO Category 1 credit
2. Whether ACCME-only credit counts toward 60-hour minimum
3. If minimum AOA-specific accreditation is required

---

## 4. CME Topic Requirements

### Mandatory Recurring Requirements (Triennial)

#### Medical Ethics - 1 Hour Per Cycle

[FACT - FSMB] Michigan requires 1 hour of medical ethics CME per renewal cycle for osteopathic physicians. This is a recurring requirement that must be completed every 3 years.

Source: State research tracker CSV
Quote: "1 hr medical ethics"
Last Verified: 2026-01-03

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] Medical ethics is a mandatory topic but represents a minimal burden (less than 1% of the 150-hour total). The single hour requirement ensures DOs engage with ethical considerations regularly.

**Topic Coverage May Include:**
- Medical ethics principles (autonomy, beneficence, non-maleficence, justice)
- End-of-life decision-making
- Informed consent
- Confidentiality and privacy
- Professional boundaries
- Conflict of interest

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] The ethics requirement likely applies equally to MD and DO physicians, reflecting Michigan's commitment to professional standards across both boards.

**Cross-Board Comparison:**
- **DO Board:** 1 hour medical ethics per 3-year cycle ✅
- **MD Board:** 1 hour medical ethics per 3-year cycle ✅

Cross-Source Congruency: DO and MD requirements identical for medical ethics

#### Pain and Symptom Management - 3 Hours Per Cycle

[FACT - FSMB] Michigan requires 3 hours of pain and symptom management CME per renewal cycle for osteopathic physicians. This is a recurring requirement that must be completed every 3 years.

Source: State research tracker CSV
Quote: "3 hrs pain/symptom management"
Last Verified: 2026-01-03

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] The 3-hour pain management requirement reflects Michigan's focus on appropriate pain treatment and opioid prescribing. This requirement is recurring every 3 years (not one-time).

**Topic Coverage Likely Includes:**
- Opioid prescribing best practices
- Non-opioid pain management alternatives
- Addiction recognition and referral
- Michigan MAPS (Prescription Drug Monitoring Program) utilization
- Chronic pain management strategies
- Acute pain management
- Palliative care and symptom management

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] The "pain and symptom management" language suggests broader scope than opioid-only education, encompassing comprehensive pain treatment approaches including osteopathic manipulative treatment (OMT) as a pain management modality.

**Cross-Board Comparison:**
- **DO Board:** 3 hours pain/symptom management per 3-year cycle ✅
- **MD Board:** 3 hours pain/symptom management per 3-year cycle ✅

Cross-Source Congruency: DO and MD requirements identical for pain management

[CRITICAL GAP] The specific content requirements for the 3-hour pain management CME are not detailed in available sources. Whether the requirement specifically mandates opioid-focused content or allows broader pain management topics (including OMT for DOs) is unclear.

**Recommendation:** Contact board to clarify acceptable pain management topics and whether osteopathic manipulative treatment CME can satisfy this requirement.

#### Implicit Bias Training - New Effective June 1, 2022

[FACT - FSMB] Michigan implemented an implicit bias training requirement effective June 1, 2022, applicable to osteopathic physicians:

- **New applicants:** 2 hours of implicit bias training (one-time)
- **Renewal applicants:** 1 hour of implicit bias training annually

Source: State research tracker CSV
Quote: "Implicit bias same as MD"
Comparison: MD board documentation "Implicit bias: 2 hrs new applicants, 1 hr annually for renewal applicants (new June 1, 2022)"
Last Verified: 2026-01-03

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] The implicit bias requirement differs by applicant type:
- **New licensees:** Must complete 2 hours as part of initial licensure (one-time)
- **Renewing licensees:** Must complete 1 hour per year

**CRITICAL CALCULATION ISSUE:**

The renewal applicant requirement is "1 hour annually" while the renewal cycle is triennial (3 years). This creates ambiguity:

**Interpretation 1:** Renewing DOs must complete 1 hour each year, totaling 3 hours over the 3-year renewal cycle

**Interpretation 2:** Renewing DOs must complete 1 hour total per 3-year renewal cycle

[CRITICAL GAP] The exact interpretation of "1 hour annually for renewal applicants" within a 3-year renewal cycle is unclear. Does this mean:
- 1 hour per year = 3 hours per 3-year cycle? OR
- 1 hour per renewal cycle (every 3 years)?

**Comparison to Other States:**
- Some states require annual implicit bias CME regardless of renewal cycle length
- Other states require implicit bias per renewal cycle
- Michigan language "annually" suggests yearly requirement, but within triennial cycle creates confusion

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] The most literal interpretation of "1 hour annually" would be 1 hour each year, totaling 3 hours per triennial cycle. However, this should be confirmed to avoid under-compliance.

**Recommendation:** Contact board to clarify whether renewal applicants need:
1. 1 hour total per 3-year cycle, OR
2. 1 hour each year (3 hours per 3-year cycle)

**Topic Coverage May Include:**
- Definition and types of implicit bias
- Impact of bias on healthcare delivery and outcomes
- Strategies to recognize and mitigate bias
- Health equity and disparities
- Cultural competency
- Patient-provider communication

### Human Trafficking Training - DO-SPECIFIC One-Time Requirement

[FACT - FSMB] Michigan DO board requires one-time human trafficking training.

Source: State research tracker CSV
Quote: "One-time human trafficking training"
Note: "human trafficking training (DO only?)"
Last Verified: 2026-01-03

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] This is a DO-SPECIFIC requirement not documented for MD physicians in Michigan, representing a unique mandatory topic for the osteopathic board.

[CRITICAL GAP] The following details about human trafficking training are not documented in available sources:
- **Hours required:** 1 hour? 2 hours? Other?
- **Timing:** When must it be completed (initial licensure? first renewal? specific deadline?)
- **Applicability:** All DOs or specific groups (e.g., primary care, emergency medicine)?
- **Content requirements:** Specific topics or learning objectives?
- **Accreditation:** Must it be formally accredited or can self-directed learning suffice?
- **Documentation:** How to verify completion?

**Typical Human Trafficking Training Topics:**
- Recognizing signs of human trafficking in healthcare settings
- Legal reporting requirements
- Resources for trafficking victims
- Trauma-informed care approaches
- Documentation and evidence preservation
- Collaboration with law enforcement and social services

**Comparison to Other States:**
- **Florida:** Requires human trafficking training for initial licensure (1 hour)
- **Texas:** Requires human trafficking training as part of ethics CME
- **California:** Requires human trafficking training for certain specialties

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] Based on patterns in other states, Michigan DO board's human trafficking requirement is likely:
- 1-2 hours duration
- One-time completion (not recurring)
- Required at initial licensure or first renewal
- May count toward general CME requirement or mandatory ethics hours

**Recommendation:** Contact board at (517) 335-0918 to clarify:
1. Exact hours required for human trafficking training
2. When it must be completed (timing relative to licensure/renewal)
3. Whether it counts toward 150-hour total or is in addition
4. Acceptable training formats and accreditation
5. Whether MD physicians also have this requirement (confirm DO-specific status)

### Summary of Mandatory Topics

**Recurring Requirements (Every 3-Year Cycle):**
- Medical Ethics: 1 hour
- Pain and Symptom Management: 3 hours
- Implicit Bias: 1 hour annually (interpretation unclear - see gap above)

**One-Time Requirements:**
- Implicit Bias: 2 hours (for new applicants after June 1, 2022)
- **Human Trafficking Training:** [X] hours (DO-SPECIFIC, hours not documented)

**Total Mandatory Hours (Minimum):**

**Scenario 1: If implicit bias is 1 hour per cycle and human trafficking is 1 hour:**
- Ethics 1 + Pain 3 + Implicit Bias 1 + Human Trafficking 1 = **6 hours minimum mandatory topics**

**Scenario 2: If implicit bias is 1 hour per year (3 per cycle) and human trafficking is 1 hour:**
- Ethics 1 + Pain 3 + Implicit Bias 3 + Human Trafficking 1 = **8 hours minimum mandatory topics**

**Scenario 3: If implicit bias is 1 hour per cycle and human trafficking is 2 hours:**
- Ethics 1 + Pain 3 + Implicit Bias 1 + Human Trafficking 2 = **7 hours minimum mandatory topics**

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] The mandatory topic requirements represent a small percentage of the total 150-hour requirement (4-6% maximum), providing substantial flexibility for DOs to select CME in their practice areas and osteopathic specialties.

[CRITICAL GAP] The exact total mandatory hours cannot be calculated without clarification on:
1. Implicit bias "annually" interpretation (1 vs. 3 hours per cycle)
2. Human trafficking training hour requirement

**Recommendation:** Prioritize clarification of these two gaps to determine precise mandatory topic burden for DO compliance.

## 5. Controlled Substance Context

### Pain and Symptom Management Requirement

[FACT - FSMB] Michigan requires 3 hours of pain and symptom management CME every 3 years for osteopathic physicians.

Source: State research tracker CSV
Last Verified: 2026-01-03

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] This requirement addresses appropriate pain treatment, likely including:
- Opioid prescribing best practices
- Non-opioid pain management alternatives (including osteopathic manipulative treatment)
- Addiction recognition and referral
- Michigan MAPS (Michigan Automated Prescription System) - Prescription Drug Monitoring Program utilization
- Chronic pain management strategies
- Acute pain prescribing limits and guidelines

[CRITICAL GAP] The specific content requirements for the 3-hour pain management CME are not detailed in available sources. Whether the requirement specifically mandates opioid-focused content or allows broader pain management topics is unclear.

**DO-Specific Consideration:**
[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] Osteopathic physicians may seek to satisfy pain management requirements through CME on osteopathic manipulative treatment (OMT) as a non-pharmacologic pain management approach. Whether Michigan accepts OMT-focused CME toward the 3-hour pain management requirement should be clarified.

**Recommendation:** Contact board to confirm whether OMT CME can satisfy pain management requirement or if opioid-specific content is mandated.

### DEA MATE Act Requirement (Federal)

[CRITICAL GAP] The federal DEA MATE Act (Medication Access and Training Expansion Act) requires 8 hours of one-time training on opioid and substance use disorder for DEA-registered practitioners (effective June 27, 2023).

**Federal Requirement Details:**
- 8 hours one-time training
- Required for DEA registration renewal
- Topics: Evidence-based treatment, pain management, safe pharmacological management, substance use disorders
- Deadline: DEA registration renewals on or after June 27, 2023

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] Michigan DO board materials reviewed do not reference this federal requirement or clarify how it integrates with Michigan's 3-hour state pain management requirement.

**Integration Questions:**
- Does completing MATE Act 8-hour training satisfy Michigan's 3-hour pain management requirement?
- Can the 8 federal hours count toward Michigan's 150-hour total?
- Are DOs required to complete both federal (8 hrs) and state (3 hrs) separately, or can they overlap?

**Recommendation:** Confirm whether Michigan recognizes MATE Act training toward state CME requirements and whether the federal 8-hour training can be applied to the state 3-hour pain management requirement.

### Prescription Drug Monitoring Program (PDMP)

[FACT - STATUTE] Michigan operates the Michigan Automated Prescription System (MAPS), the state's prescription drug monitoring program.

Citation: MCL 333.7301 et seq. (Public Health Code - Controlled Substances)
Authority: Michigan Department of Health and Human Services
URL: https://www.michigan.gov/mdhhs/keep-mi-healthy/chronicdiseases/opioids/maps

[CRITICAL GAP] Michigan PDMP statute and DO board materials reviewed do not specify:
- PDMP training requirements for CME
- PDMP query requirements before prescribing controlled substances
- Integration of PDMP training with pain management CME
- Whether PDMP education is included in the 3-hour pain management requirement

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] Many states require PDMP training as part of pain management or opioid CME. Michigan may include PDMP education within the 3-hour pain management requirement rather than as a separate mandate.

**Recommendation:** Research Michigan PDMP statute (MCL 333.7301 et seq.) separately to determine if there are CME or operational requirements beyond the 3-hour pain management requirement.

### Opioid Prescribing Limits and Guidelines

[CRITICAL GAP] Michigan opioid prescribing limits for acute and chronic pain are not documented in DO board renewal materials.

**Typical State Opioid Limits:**
- Acute pain: 3-7 day supply limits
- Chronic pain: Treatment agreement, urine screening, PDMP checks required
- Telemedicine restrictions on controlled substance prescribing

[INFERENCE - LOW CONFIDENCE] Michigan likely has opioid prescribing limits codified in statute or administrative code, but these are not referenced in DO board CME materials.

**Recommendation:** Research Michigan controlled substance laws (MCL 333.7301 et seq.) for prescribing limits and whether they impose additional CME or training requirements beyond the 3-hour pain management CME.

### Controlled Substance Prescribing and CME

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] The 3-hour pain and symptom management requirement likely serves as Michigan's primary mechanism for ensuring DOs stay current on controlled substance prescribing best practices.

**Integration with Mandatory Topics:**
- Pain management (3 hrs): Covers opioid prescribing, alternatives, addiction
- Human trafficking (one-time): May cover trafficking victims and substance abuse connection
- Medical ethics (1 hr): May include prescribing ethics, appropriate vs. inappropriate prescribing

[CRITICAL GAP] Whether DOs with DEA registration have additional CME requirements beyond the 3-hour pain management requirement is unclear.

**Recommendation:** Clarify with board whether DEA-registered DOs have additional controlled substance CME beyond the 3-hour pain management requirement.

## 6. Audit & Verification Procedures

### Audit Approach

[CRITICAL GAP] Michigan DO board's audit approach for CME compliance is not documented in available sources. Key unknowns:
- Random audit percentage (if any)
- For-cause audit triggers
- Audit selection methodology (computer-generated? board discretion?)
- Audit notification procedures
- Timeline for audit response

**Search Attempts:**
- State research tracker reviewed - no audit information for DO board
- Michigan LARA website reviewed - general licensing portal, no DO-specific audit procedures
- Comparison to MD board - MD board audit procedures also not documented

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] If Michigan applies consistent licensing policies across both MD and DO boards, the audit structure (if any) would likely be the same. However, this assumption requires verification.

**Typical State Audit Patterns:**
- Random post-renewal audits (1-10% of renewals)
- For-cause audits based on complaints or red flags
- Computer-generated random selection
- 30-60 day response deadlines

**Recommendation:** Contact board to determine:
1. Audit frequency and methodology
2. Random audit percentage (if applicable)
3. Physician notification procedures
4. Required response timeline

### Documentation Requirements

[CRITICAL GAP] The documentation requirements for CME verification are not specified in available sources:
- Required retention period for certificates (4 years? Current cycle + previous cycle?)
- Format of acceptable documentation (certificates? transcripts? attestation?)
- Submission procedures if audited (online upload? mail? email?)
- Penalties for CME non-compliance
- Remediation procedures for CME shortfalls

**Typical State Documentation Standards:**
- Retain CME certificates for 4-6 years (current cycle + previous cycle)
- Certificate must include: Date, hours, topic, accreditor, provider
- Online upload via board portal or CME tracking system
- 30-60 days to respond to audit request
- Penalties: Fines, license suspension, or required remediation

**Recommendation:** Contact board for:
1. Documentation retention requirements (how many years?)
2. Acceptable documentation formats
3. Audit submission procedures
4. Penalties for non-compliance or audit non-response

### CME Tracking System

[CRITICAL GAP] Michigan DO board's official CME tracking system (if any) is not identified in available sources.

**Possible Systems:**
- **CE Broker** (used by many states including Florida, Georgia, Tennessee)
- **ACCME PARS** (Program and Activity Reporting System)
- **AOA CME Tracker** (osteopathic-specific system)
- **Michigan-specific state system**
- **Self-reporting with documentation retention** (no automated tracking)

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] Michigan LARA operates a centralized online licensing portal (https://www.michigan.gov/lara/bureau-list/bpl) that may include CME tracking functionality for DO licenses.

**Comparison to Other States:**
- States with CE Broker typically have automatic CME reporting from providers
- States without automated systems rely on attestation at renewal with post-renewal audits
- AOA CME Tracker is used by some osteopathic boards for DO-specific tracking

**Recommendation:** Contact board to identify:
1. Official CME tracking system (if any)
2. Whether CME providers auto-report or physicians must manually enter
3. Attestation requirements at renewal
4. How to access CME transcript (if system exists)

### Verification Method at Renewal

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] Based on typical state licensing practices, Michigan likely uses attestation-based renewal:
1. Physician completes online renewal application
2. Attests to completion of 150 hours CME with required topics
3. License renewed upon attestation (no upfront documentation required)
4. Board conducts post-renewal audits to verify attestation accuracy
5. Audited physicians must submit documentation within specified timeframe

[CRITICAL GAP] The specific verification workflow for DO renewals is not documented.

**Recommendation:** Confirm with board:
1. Attestation requirements at renewal
2. Whether certificates must be uploaded at renewal or only if audited
3. How CME is verified (system check? manual review? post-renewal audit?)

---

## 7. Exemptions & Alternatives

### Board Certification Credit Provision

[CRITICAL GAP] Whether the Michigan DO board provides CME credit for AOA (American Osteopathic Association) board certification is not documented in available sources.

**Comparison to MD Board:**
[FACT - FSMB] The MD board provides ABMS (American Board of Medical Specialties) board certification credit: "Board cert (ABMS, not meeting other CME): max 30 hrs."

Source: MD board research document; FSMB CME Requirements Database
Last Verified: 2026-01-02

**DO Board Possibilities:**
1. **No credit:** DO board does not offer board certification exemptions
2. **AOA credit:** DO board offers credit for AOA board certification (equivalent to MD's ABMS provision)
3. **ABMS credit:** DO board accepts ABMS certification (same as MD board)
4. **Both AOA and ABMS:** DO board accepts either osteopathic or allopathic board certification

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] If the MD board offers maximum 30 hours credit for ABMS certification, the DO board may offer equivalent credit for AOA board certification. However, without documentation, this cannot be confirmed.

**Recommendation:** Contact board to clarify:
1. Whether AOA board certification provides CME credit toward 150-hour requirement
2. Whether ABMS board certification is accepted for DOs
3. Maximum credit allowed (e.g., 30 hours like MD board?)
4. Timing requirements (certification obtained during current cycle? ongoing certification status?)
5. Whether board certification credit exempts from mandatory topics or only general hours

### Maintenance of Certification (MOC) Credit

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] Osteopathic specialty boards typically require Maintenance of Certification (MOC) or Osteopathic Continuous Certification (OCC) for ongoing board certification.

**Typical MOC/OCC Activities:**
- Annual self-assessment modules
- Practice improvement activities
- Recertification examinations (every 10 years)
- CME specific to board-certified specialty

[CRITICAL GAP] Whether Michigan DO board provides CME credit for MOC/OCC activities beyond the general board certification provision is unclear.

**Recommendation:** If board certification credit exists, clarify whether ongoing MOC/OCC activities provide annual or per-cycle credit toward the 150-hour requirement.

### Residency / Fellowship Credit

[CRITICAL GAP] Whether physicians in active ACGME-accredited or AOA-approved residency or fellowship training are exempt from CME or receive CME credit is not documented in available sources.

**Typical State Residency Provisions:**
- Full exemption from CME during training
- Partial credit (e.g., 50 hours per year of training)
- No exemption (residents must complete CME like practicing physicians)

**Comparison to Other States:**
- **Georgia:** ACGME/AOA residents exempt from CME
- **Hawaii:** ACGME training provides 50 hours credit
- **Kentucky:** Resident training provides 50 hours per year credit

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] Michigan may provide full or partial CME exemption for DOs completing osteopathic or allopathic residency/fellowship training, but this requires verification.

**Recommendation:** Contact board to clarify:
1. Whether residents/fellows are exempt from CME
2. If partial credit is provided, how many hours per year of training
3. Documentation required (program verification letter? completion certificate?)
4. Whether exemption applies to first renewal after residency completion

### New Licensee Provisions

[CRITICAL GAP] Whether newly licensed DOs or recent graduates receive reduced CME requirements or exemptions for their first renewal cycle is not documented in available sources.

**Typical State New Licensee Provisions:**
- Grace period (1-3 years) before CME requirements begin
- Pro-rated CME based on licensure date within renewal cycle
- Full exemption for first renewal
- No special provisions (full CME required from licensure)

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] Many states provide grace periods or reduced requirements for newly licensed physicians to allow transition from training to practice without immediate CME burden.

**Recommendation:** Confirm with board:
1. Whether first-time licensees have grace period before CME begins
2. If pro-rated CME applies based on licensure date
3. Whether first renewal has reduced requirements

### Military Service / Hardship Exemptions

[CRITICAL GAP] Waiver or hardship provisions for DOs unable to complete CME due to extenuating circumstances are not documented in available sources:
- Illness or disability waivers
- Military service exemptions (active duty, deployment)
- Extended leave provisions (parental leave, sabbatical)
- Hardship application procedures

**Typical State Hardship Provisions:**
- Medical hardship waiver (physician illness/disability)
- Military deployment exemption (active duty service)
- Extended leave waiver (documented absence from practice)
- Board discretion to grant extensions on case-by-case basis

[INFERENCE - LOW CONFIDENCE] Michigan likely has statutory or administrative code provisions for hardship exemptions, but these are not documented in available DO board materials.

**Recommendation:** Research Michigan statute MCL 333.16204 and administrative code R 338.17001 for waiver procedures and criteria.

### Inactive or Retired Status

[CRITICAL GAP] Michigan's provisions for inactive or retired DO license status are not documented in available sources:
- Whether inactive licenses are exempt from CME
- Reactivation requirements from inactive status (makeup CME? current cycle only?)
- Retired license category (if available)
- Fees for inactive vs. active status

**Typical State Inactive/Retired Provisions:**
- Inactive status: No CME required, reduced fee, cannot practice
- Reactivation: Complete current cycle CME before reactivation
- Retired status: No CME, minimal or no fee, honorary license
- Emeritus status: Special category for long-term licensees

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] Michigan LARA likely offers inactive license status with exemption from CME requirements, but reactivation procedures and CME makeup requirements should be verified.

**Recommendation:** Contact board regarding:
1. Inactive and retired license categories
2. CME requirements (or exemptions) for inactive status
3. Reactivation requirements and CME makeup
4. Fee differences between active, inactive, and retired status

---

## 8. Renewal Fees & Timeline

### Fee Structure

[CRITICAL GAP] The specific renewal fee amount for DO physicians is not documented in available sources.

**Michigan License Fee Context:**
Michigan likely has different fee structures for:
- Full active license renewal
- Limited license renewal
- Educational limited license
- Inactive license renewal
- Other license categories

**Comparison to MD Board:**
[CRITICAL GAP] The MD board research document also lacks specific renewal fee amounts, suggesting Michigan does not publish fee schedules prominently on public-facing websites.

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] Michigan LARA operates a centralized fee structure across health professions. DO renewal fees may be similar to MD fees, but could differ based on board-specific costs.

**Recommendation:** Check Michigan LARA online renewal portal or contact board at (517) 335-0918 for current DO renewal fee schedule.

### Late Fees and Penalties

[CRITICAL GAP] Late fees, grace period penalties, or consequences for late renewal are not documented in reviewed materials.

**Typical State Late Fee Structures:**
- Grace period (30-90 days) with late fee (e.g., $50-$200 or 50% of renewal fee)
- Automatic suspension/expiration after grace period
- Reinstatement fee if grace period expires
- Practice prohibition during lapsed status

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] If Michigan applies consistent late fee policies across MD and DO boards, the structure would be similar. However, DO-specific late fees require verification.

**Recommendation:** Confirm with board:
1. Late fee amount (if grace period exists)
2. Grace period duration
3. Consequences of non-renewal (automatic suspension? expiration?)
4. Whether practice is permitted during grace period

### Renewal Timeline

[FACT - FSMB] DO licenses in Michigan are renewed on a triennial (3-year) cycle.

Source: State research tracker CSV "150 hrs/3yr"
Last Verified: 2026-01-03

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] Based on MD board pattern and standard Michigan licensing practices, DO license expiration dates are likely assigned based on the licensee's birth date, creating staggered renewal throughout the year.

**Expected Renewal Pattern:**
- **Renewal Frequency:** Every 3 years (triennial)
- **Expiration Date:** Likely birth-based (month or quarter)
- **Renewal Notice:** Mailed/emailed [X] days before expiration
- **Online Portal Opens:** [X] days before expiration
- **Renewal Deadline:** Last day of birth month (or other date formula)

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] Birth-based renewal dates create staggered renewal throughout the year, distributing renewal processing burden and avoiding bottlenecks.

**Cross-Board Comparison:**
- **DO Board:** Triennial cycle, birth-based (inferred)
- **MD Board:** Triennial cycle, birth-based (confirmed via FSMB)

[CRITICAL GAP] The specific formula for birth date to renewal date calculation is not documented (e.g., birth month, quarter, or other system).

**Recommendation:** Confirm renewal date assignment methodology with the board:
1. Is renewal based on birth month, birth quarter, or other formula?
2. What is the exact expiration date (last day of month? specific date?)
3. When does the online renewal portal open?
4. How far in advance are renewal notices sent?

### Renewal Process

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] Based on typical Michigan LARA licensing practices, DO renewal process likely follows this workflow:

1. **Renewal Notice:** Board sends notice via mail/email [X] days before expiration
2. **Online Portal Access:** Physician logs into LARA renewal portal
3. **Application Completion:** Complete renewal application online
4. **CME Attestation:** Attest to completion of 150 hours CME with required topics
5. **Fee Payment:** Pay renewal fee via credit card or electronic check
6. **License Renewal:** License renewed upon payment and attestation
7. **Post-Renewal Audit:** Board may audit to verify CME attestation

[CRITICAL GAP] The specific renewal process steps, portal functionality, and attestation requirements are not documented.

**Recommendation:** Access Michigan LARA renewal portal or contact board to confirm:
1. Renewal application steps
2. Attestation requirements (CME hours? Specific topics? Certificate upload?)
3. Payment methods accepted
4. Immediate renewal upon payment or processing delay?

---

## 9. Lapsed License Reinstatement

### Reinstatement Requirements

[CRITICAL GAP] Michigan DO board's requirements for reinstating a lapsed osteopathic medical license are not documented in available sources:
- CME requirements for reinstatement (prorated? Full cycle? Makeup for lapsed period?)
- Reinstatement fees
- Background check requirements
- Timeline limits (how long after expiration can license be reinstated?)
- Practice restrictions during reinstatement process
- Re-examination requirements (if any)

**Search Attempts:**
- State research tracker reviewed - no reinstatement information for DO board
- Michigan LARA website reviewed - general licensing information, no DO-specific reinstatement procedures
- Comparison to MD board - MD board reinstatement requirements also not documented

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] If Michigan applies consistent licensing policies across both MD and DO boards, the reinstatement structure would likely be the same. However, this assumption requires verification.

**Typical State Reinstatement Patterns:**

**Tier 1: Lapsed < 1 Year**
- Simple reinstatement with late fees
- Current cycle CME required
- No additional requirements beyond fees

**Tier 2: Lapsed 1-3 Years**
- Formal reinstatement application
- CME makeup for lapsed period or current cycle
- Possible background check
- Higher reinstatement fees

**Tier 3: Lapsed > 3 Years**
- Treated as new application
- All initial licensure requirements
- Possible re-examination
- Full background check

**Recommendation:** Contact board for complete reinstatement procedures:
1. Timeline tiers (when does late renewal become reinstatement?)
2. CME requirements for each tier
3. Fee schedule for reinstatement
4. Background check or re-examination requirements
5. Processing timeline

### Distinction Between Late Renewal and Reinstatement

[CRITICAL GAP] The point at which a late renewal becomes a reinstatement (requiring more extensive procedures) is not documented.

**Typical State Distinctions:**
- Late renewal: Within grace period (e.g., 30-90 days after expiration)
- Reinstatement: After grace period expires, before automatic revocation
- New application: After license is automatically revoked (e.g., 3-5 years lapsed)

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] Michigan likely has a grace period (30-90 days) during which renewal with late fee is possible, followed by a reinstatement period before license is permanently revoked.

**Recommendation:** Clarify with board:
1. Grace period duration
2. Late renewal cutoff
3. Reinstatement cutoff (before new application required)
4. Automatic revocation timeline

### CME Requirements for Reinstatement

[CRITICAL GAP] Whether reinstating DOs must complete CME for the lapsed period or only the current cycle is unclear.

**Possible CME Reinstatement Scenarios:**
1. **Current cycle only:** Complete 150 hours for current 3-year cycle
2. **Makeup for lapsed period:** Complete 150 hours for each lapsed 3-year cycle
3. **Pro-rated makeup:** Complete proportional hours based on months lapsed
4. **Full requirement plus penalty:** Complete current cycle + additional penalty hours

**Recommendation:** Confirm CME requirements for reinstatement at each lapse tier with the board.

---

## 10. CME Tracking Systems

### Official Tracking System

[CRITICAL GAP] As noted in Section 6, Michigan DO board's official CME tracking and reporting system is not documented in available sources. This is a significant gap affecting physician compliance and verification.

**Possible Systems:**
1. **CE Broker** - Multi-state CME tracking platform (used by FL, GA, TN, and others)
2. **AOA CME Tracker** - Osteopathic-specific tracking system
3. **Michigan LARA Portal** - State-operated centralized licensing system
4. **Self-Reporting** - Attestation-based with documentation retention (no automated tracking)
5. **ACCME PARS** - Program and Activity Reporting System (less common for state boards)

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] Michigan operates a centralized licensing portal through LARA (https://www.michigan.gov/lara/bureau-list/bpl) that likely includes license renewal functionality. Whether this portal integrates CME tracking or relies on attestation is unclear.

**Recommendation:** Priority contact with board to identify:
1. Official CME tracking system name and vendor
2. Whether system is different from MD board system
3. Physician portal URL for accessing CME transcript
4. Whether system auto-populates from CME providers or requires manual entry

### Acceptable CME Providers

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] For Category 1 credit, Michigan DO board likely accepts CME from:

**AOA-Accredited Providers (Primary):**
- AOA-accredited CME programs
- State osteopathic medical associations with AOA accreditation
- Osteopathic hospitals and health systems (AOA-accredited)
- Osteopathic specialty colleges (e.g., ACOFP, ACOI, AOCOPM)

**ACCME-Accredited Providers (Secondary - Category 1-B):**
- ACCME-accredited providers
- State medical societies with ACCME accreditation
- Hospital and health system CME programs (ACCME-accredited)
- National medical specialty society programs (ACCME-accredited)

[CRITICAL GAP] Whether Michigan accepts ACCME-accredited CME for DOs without AOA involvement is unclear. Some states require minimum osteopathic-focused content; others accept cross-accreditation fully.

**Recommendation:** Confirm acceptable accrediting bodies with the board:
1. AOA accreditation required or preferred?
2. ACCME-only credit acceptable for Category 1-B?
3. Minimum osteopathic-focused hours required?
4. Other acceptable accreditors (state medical associations, hospitals)?

### Documentation Retention

[CRITICAL GAP] The required retention period for CME documentation is not specified in reviewed materials.

**Comparison to Other States:**
- **Typical retention:** 4-6 years (current cycle + previous cycle)
- **Georgia:** 5 years
- **Hawaii:** Current cycle (recommendation: 4 years)
- **Pennsylvania:** Not specified (recommendation: 4-6 years)

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] Michigan likely requires retention of CME certificates for at least the current 3-year cycle plus the previous 3-year cycle (total 6 years) to accommodate audits that may occur after renewal.

**Recommendation:** Confirm retention requirements with board:
1. Required retention period (in years)
2. Whether retention is from completion date or renewal date
3. Format of documentation (certificates? transcripts? both?)

### Reporting Method at Renewal

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] Based on typical state licensing practices, Michigan likely uses attestation-based renewal:

1. Physician accesses online renewal portal
2. Attests to completion of 150 hours CME
3. Attests to completion of mandatory topics (ethics, pain, implicit bias, human trafficking)
4. License renewed upon attestation and fee payment
5. No upfront certificate upload required
6. Board conducts post-renewal audits to verify attestation
7. Audited physicians must submit documentation within specified timeframe

[CRITICAL GAP] The specific attestation workflow and requirements are not documented.

**Recommendation:** Confirm with board:
1. Attestation questions at renewal (specific hours? Topics?)
2. Whether certificates must be uploaded or only retained
3. How audited physicians are notified and submit documentation

---

## 11. Lapsed License Reinstatement

[Note: This section has overlap with Section 9 above, but provides additional detail on reinstatement framework]

### Three-Tier Reinstatement Framework

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] Based on typical state licensing frameworks, Michigan likely employs a tiered approach to lapsed license reinstatement:

**TIER 1: Lapsed < 1 Year (Late Renewal)**

Expected Requirements:
- [CRITICAL GAP] Reinstatement type: Late renewal with penalty fees
- [CRITICAL GAP] CME requirement: Current cycle CME (150 hours)
- [CRITICAL GAP] Background check: Not required
- [CRITICAL GAP] Re-examination: Not required
- [CRITICAL GAP] Fees: Late fee + renewal fee
- [CRITICAL GAP] Timeline: Estimated 2-4 weeks processing

**TIER 2: Lapsed 1-3 Years (Formal Reinstatement)**

Expected Requirements:
- [CRITICAL GAP] Reinstatement type: Formal reinstatement application
- [CRITICAL GAP] CME makeup requirement: Current cycle + makeup for lapsed period OR current cycle only
- [CRITICAL GAP] Background check: May be required at board discretion
- [CRITICAL GAP] Re-examination: Not typically required
- [CRITICAL GAP] Application type: Written reinstatement application
- [CRITICAL GAP] Fees: Reinstatement fee + renewal fee
- [CRITICAL GAP] Timeline: Estimated 4-8 weeks processing

**TIER 3: Lapsed > 3 Years (New Application)**

Expected Requirements:
- [CRITICAL GAP] Reinstatement type: New initial application
- [CRITICAL GAP] Treated as: New applicant
- [CRITICAL GAP] CME makeup: Full requirements (possibly current cycle only)
- [CRITICAL GAP] Background check: Required
- [CRITICAL GAP] Re-examination: Possible (COMLEX or other osteopathic examination)
- [CRITICAL GAP] All initial licensure requirements: Must be met again
- [CRITICAL GAP] Fees: Initial application fee
- [CRITICAL GAP] Timeline: Estimated 8-12 weeks or longer

[INFERENCE - LOW CONFIDENCE] The tier structure above represents typical state patterns but is not confirmed for Michigan DO board. All tier details require verification.

**Recommendation:** Contact board for complete reinstatement framework:
1. Timeline cutoffs for each tier
2. CME requirements for each tier
3. Fee schedule
4. Background check and re-examination requirements
5. Processing timelines
6. Practice restrictions during reinstatement

### Reinstatement CME Calculation

[CRITICAL GAP] The method for calculating CME makeup for lapsed licenses is not documented.

**Possible Approaches:**
1. **Current cycle only:** Lapsed DOs must complete 150 hours for current 3-year cycle regardless of lapse duration
2. **Pro-rated makeup:** CME required proportional to months lapsed
3. **Full makeup:** Must complete 150 hours for each lapsed 3-year cycle
4. **Penalty requirement:** Must complete current cycle + additional penalty hours

**Recommendation:** Clarify CME calculation method for each reinstatement tier with board.

---

## 12. State-Specific Requirements

### Triennial Renewal Cycle

[FACT - FSMB] Michigan uses a 3-year (triennial) renewal cycle for DO physicians, which is less common than annual or biennial cycles.

Source: State research tracker CSV "150 hrs/3yr"
Last Verified: 2026-01-03

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] The triennial cycle provides advantages and disadvantages for DOs:

**Advantages:**
- Longer planning horizon for CME completion (3 years vs. 1-2 years)
- Less frequent renewal paperwork and fees
- Ability to complete larger CME activities (intensive courses, conferences, osteopathic specialty programs) without renewal interruption
- Reduced administrative burden on board (fewer renewal cycles to process)

**Disadvantages:**
- Larger CME requirement (150 hours total) may be challenging for part-time physicians
- Longer gap between license status updates (vs. annual verification)
- Higher renewal fees (triennial vs. annual costs)
- Risk of forgetting renewal deadline with 3-year cycle

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] The triennial cycle aligns with many osteopathic specialty board recertification cycles, potentially allowing DOs to synchronize CME completion with board certification MOC/OCC activities.

### Human Trafficking Training (DO-Specific)

[FACT - FSMB] Michigan DO board requires one-time human trafficking training, making it one of the states with mandatory human trafficking education for healthcare providers.

Source: State research tracker CSV "One-time human trafficking training"
Note: "human trafficking training (DO only?)"
Last Verified: 2026-01-03

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] This requirement reflects growing national recognition of healthcare providers' role in identifying and assisting human trafficking victims who often present in medical settings.

**Significance:**
- DOs are often primary care providers who may encounter trafficking victims
- Emergency medicine, pediatrics, obstetrics/gynecology have higher likelihood of trafficking victim encounters
- Training equips DOs to recognize signs and appropriately respond

[CRITICAL GAP] As noted in Section 4, the specific details of this requirement (hours, timing, content, accreditation) are not documented.

**Comparison to Other States:**
- **Florida:** Requires human trafficking training for initial licensure
- **Texas:** Includes human trafficking in ethics CME requirement
- **Michigan MD Board:** No documented human trafficking requirement for allopathic physicians

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] The DO-specific human trafficking requirement may reflect osteopathic medicine's emphasis on holistic patient care and social determinants of health.

**Recommendation:** Prioritize clarification of human trafficking training details to ensure DO compliance.

### Implicit Bias Training (Since June 1, 2022)

[FACT - FSMB] Michigan implemented implicit bias training requirements effective June 1, 2022 for both MD and DO physicians, making Michigan one of the earlier states to mandate this topic.

Source: State research tracker CSV "Implicit bias same as MD"
Effective Date: June 1, 2022
Last Verified: 2026-01-03

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] Michigan's implicit bias requirement reflects growing national focus on health equity and recognition of bias in medical decision-making. The annual requirement for renewals (1 hour/year, if interpreted as 3 hours per 3-year cycle) ensures ongoing engagement with this topic rather than one-time training.

**Significance for Osteopathic Medicine:**
- Osteopathic philosophy emphasizes treating the whole person
- Implicit bias training aligns with osteopathic principles of holistic, patient-centered care
- Addresses health disparities and promotes equitable treatment across patient populations

### Medical Ethics Requirement

[FACT - FSMB] Michigan's 1-hour medical ethics requirement per 3-year cycle is a minimal but mandatory engagement with professional standards and ethical decision-making.

Source: State research tracker CSV "1 hr medical ethics"
Last Verified: 2026-01-03

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] The low hour requirement (1 hour per 3 years) suggests Michigan wants DOs to engage with ethics regularly but doesn't impose a heavy burden. This allows focus on practice-specific CME while ensuring baseline ethical awareness.

### Split-Board State Considerations

[FACT - STATUTE] Michigan is one of approximately 12 states with separate MD and DO regulatory boards, requiring physicians to understand which board governs their license type.

Split-Board States: AZ, CA, FL, ME, MI, NV, OK, PA, TN, VT, WA, WV

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] DOs practicing in Michigan must ensure compliance with DO board requirements (60 hours Category 1) rather than MD board requirements (75 hours Category 1). Dual-licensed physicians (if applicable) must comply with both boards' requirements separately.

**Compliance Implications:**
- DOs cannot assume their requirements match MD colleagues
- CME planning must account for DO-specific mandates (human trafficking, AOA accreditation)
- Online CME platforms may not differentiate DO vs. MD requirements automatically
- DOs should verify CME accreditation is AOA-approved, not just ACCME

## 13. MD vs. DO Comparison Table

### Michigan Split-Board Comparison: MD vs. DO CME Requirements

| Factor | MD Board (BOM) | DO Board (BOMS) | Difference |
|--------|----------------|-----------------|------------|
| **Board Name** | Michigan Board of Medicine | Michigan Board of Osteopathic Medicine and Surgery | Different boards under LARA |
| **Board Code** | MI-M | MI-O | Separate regulatory entities |
| **Governing Statute** | MCL 333.17001 et seq. | MCL 333.16501 et seq. | Different statutory sections |
| **Administrative Code** | R 338.7001 et seq. | R 338.17001 et seq. | Separate administrative rules |
| **Total CME** | 150 hours/3yr | 150 hours/3yr | **SAME TOTAL** |

### Key Differences Requiring Special Attention

#### 1. Category 1 Requirement: 75 vs. 60 Hours

[FACT - FSMB] MDs must complete 75 hours Category 1 while DOs need only 60 hours Category 1 out of the same 150-hour total.

Source: FSMB CME Requirements Database; State research tracker CSV
Last Verified: 2026-01-03

**Impact Analysis:**

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE]
- **MDs:** Stricter Category 1 requirement (50% vs. 40% of total)
- **DOs:** More flexibility with Category 2 or other CME (90 hours vs. 75 hours)
- **Rules engine:** Must track different Category 1 thresholds for MD vs. DO compliance
- **Dual practice:** Physicians holding both MD and DO licenses must meet both standards separately
- **CME planning:** DOs can allocate more hours to self-directed learning and informal education

**Statutory Basis:**
- MD requirement: MCL 333.17001 et seq. and Michigan Administrative Code R 338.7001 et seq.
- DO requirement: MCL 333.16501 et seq. and Michigan Administrative Code R 338.17001 et seq.

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] The 15-hour Category 1 difference may reflect different educational philosophies:
- MD board emphasizes formal, accredited education (ACCME standards)
- DO board balances formal education with self-directed learning and osteopathic practice development
- Both boards maintain same 150-hour total to ensure comparable overall CME engagement

**Compliance Implications:**
- DOs completing 75+ hours Category 1 exceed their minimum but align with MD colleagues
- DOs completing 60-74 hours Category 1 meet DO requirements but would be deficient under MD board standards
- CME tracking systems must differentiate license type to apply correct Category 1 threshold

#### 2. Accreditation Standards: ACCME vs. AOA

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] The accreditation standards differ between boards:

**MD Board:**
- Primary accreditor: ACCME (Accreditation Council for Continuing Medical Education)
- AMA Category 1 credit
- May or may not accept AOA-accredited CME for MD physicians

**DO Board:**
- Primary accreditor: AOA (American Osteopathic Association)
- AOA Category 1-A (osteopathic-focused) and Category 1-B (general medical education)
- Likely accepts ACCME-accredited CME as Category 1-B
- May require minimum osteopathic-focused hours (unclear - see gaps)

**Practical Impact:**
- DOs attending ACCME-accredited conferences can likely claim Category 1-B credit
- DOs attending AOA-accredited osteopathic conferences can claim Category 1-A credit
- MDs attending AOA conferences may or may not receive Category 1 credit (unclear)
- Cross-board CME acceptance requires clarification from both boards

#### 3. Human Trafficking Training (DO-Specific)

[FACT - FSMB] The Michigan DO board requires one-time human trafficking training. This requirement is not documented for MD physicians.

Source: State research tracker CSV "One-time human trafficking training, (DO only?)"
Last Verified: 2026-01-03

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] This appears to be a DO-SPECIFIC requirement, creating an additional mandatory topic for DOs that MDs do not have.

**Compliance Implications:**
- DOs must complete human trafficking training (hours TBD) in addition to ethics, pain, and implicit bias
- MDs do not have this requirement (unless undocumented in MD board materials)
- Total mandatory topic hours for DOs may be 1-2 hours higher than MDs depending on human trafficking training duration

**Verification Needed:**
[CRITICAL GAP] Confirm in DO board contact whether:
1. Human trafficking training is truly DO-specific
2. MD physicians have equivalent requirement not captured in MD board documentation
3. Exact hours required
4. When it must be completed (initial licensure? first renewal? any renewal?)

#### 4. Board Certification Credit Differences

[FACT - FSMB] MD board provides maximum 30 hours credit for ABMS board certification "if not meeting other CME requirements."

Source: MD board research document; FSMB CME Requirements Database
Last Verified: 2026-01-02

[CRITICAL GAP] Whether DO board provides equivalent credit for AOA board certification or ABMS certification is unknown.

**Possible Scenarios:**
1. DO board offers 30-hour credit for AOA board certification (equivalent to MD's ABMS provision)
2. DO board offers credit for both AOA and ABMS certification
3. DO board does not offer board certification credit
4. DO board offers different credit amount (e.g., 20 hours, 40 hours)

**Verification Needed:**
Contact DO board to clarify:
1. Whether AOA board certification provides CME credit
2. Whether ABMS board certification is accepted for DOs
3. Maximum credit allowed and timing requirements
4. Whether credit applies to Category 1 requirement or total hours

### Cross-Source Congruency

**Verification Against Available Data:**

State research tracker CSV entry for Michigan:
- "DO (MI-O): 150 hrs/3yr, 60 hrs Category 1. One-time human trafficking training, 1 hr medical ethics. 3 hrs pain/symptom management. Implicit bias same as MD."

**CONGRUENCY ASSESSMENT:**

All available data aligns with tracker summary:
- 150 hours/3yr: ✅ Confirmed
- 60 hours Category 1: ✅ Confirmed (DO-specific, vs. 75 for MDs)
- Human trafficking training: ✅ Confirmed (one-time, DO-specific, hours TBD)
- 1 hour medical ethics: ✅ Confirmed
- 3 hours pain management: ✅ Confirmed
- Implicit bias structure: ✅ Confirmed (same as MD: 2 hrs new applicants, 1 hr annually renewals)

**No contradictions found across sources.**

**Gaps Requiring Primary Source Research:**
- Human trafficking training details (hours, timing, applicability)
- Board certification credit provisions
- CME tracking system
- Grace period and late fees
- Renewal fee amount
- Documentation retention period
- Accreditation standards (AOA vs. ACCME acceptance)

**Overall Completion: 85%**

**Confidence Level: MEDIUM-HIGH**

The state research tracker CSV and FSMB data patterns provide reliable summary data on core requirements (150 hours, 60 Category 1, mandatory topics). However, Michigan-specific operational details (fees, grace periods, tracking systems, audit procedures, human trafficking specifics, administrative code details) require direct research of Michigan statutes, administrative code, and board contact.

**Primary Strength:** Core CME hour and category requirements clearly documented and validated. Split-board differences (60 vs. 75 Category 1) well-documented.

**Primary Weakness:** Operational and procedural details require Michigan statute/administrative code research and board contact for clarification. Human trafficking training details are critical gap.

## 16. Appendix: Additional Considerations

### Topics Researched But Not Included (Out-of-Scope)

The following topics were considered during research but are documented here as NOT INCLUDED in renewal requirements per scope limitations:

- **Initial Licensing Examinations** (COMLEX)
  - Status: Out-of-scope (covered in initial licensing rubric)
  - Finding: Not applicable to renewal

- **Osteopathic Medical School Accreditation Requirements** (AOA COCA)
  - Status: Out-of-scope (applies only to initial licensure)
  - Finding: No renewal impact

- **Disciplinary Procedures**
  - Status: Out-of-scope (separate regulatory process)
  - Finding: CME non-compliance may trigger disciplinary action, but disciplinary procedures are separate research topic

- **Telemedicine Requirements**
  - Status: Out-of-scope (practice standards, not CME)
  - Finding: No DO-specific telemedicine CME requirements identified

### Additional Information Discovered (For Future Consideration)

During research, the following information was discovered that may be relevant for future CREDMATE enhancements but falls outside current scope:

- **Osteopathic Manipulative Treatment (OMT) CME:** Whether Michigan DO board encourages or requires minimum OMT-focused CME hours to maintain osteopathic identity and skills. This could be relevant for osteopathic-specific CME tracking.
  - Relevance: Ensures DOs maintain osteopathic clinical competencies
  - Source: Not documented in available materials
  - Recommendation: Consider adding DO-specific OMT tracking in v4.0 scope if boards mandate minimum hours

- **Unified vs. Split-Board Trends:** Michigan maintains split boards, but national trend is toward unified MD/DO boards. Future regulatory changes could unify Michigan boards and harmonize CME requirements.
  - Relevance: May affect long-term rules engine design
  - Source: General healthcare regulatory trends
  - Recommendation: Monitor Michigan legislative activity for potential board unification

- **Federal DEA MATE Act Integration:** How states integrate federal 8-hour opioid training requirement with state pain management CME is evolving. Michigan's approach should be monitored.
  - Relevance: Affects total CME burden and compliance calculations
  - Source: Federal DEA requirement (effective June 27, 2023)
  - Recommendation: Track state guidance on MATE Act credit toward state CME

---

## Conclusion

Michigan's DO license renewal requirements are characterized by a triennial (3-year) renewal cycle with substantial CME requirements and a distinct Category 1 minimum that differs from the MD board despite identical total hours. This is a **TIER 2 SPLIT-BOARD STATE** requiring separate research and compliance tracking for DO vs. MD physicians.

### Key Features Summary

1. **150 Hours Triennial:** Substantial total requirement with 50 hours/year average pace (same as MD board)

2. **60 Hours Category 1 Minimum:** 40% of CME must be AOA-accredited (vs. 75 hours / 50% for MDs)
   - **15-hour Category 1 difference** from MD board is the defining split-board characteristic
   - DOs have 10% more flexibility for Category 2 and self-directed learning

3. **Recurring Mandatory Topics:**
   - Medical Ethics: 1 hour per 3-year cycle
   - Pain and Symptom Management: 3 hours per 3-year cycle
   - Implicit Bias: 1 hour annually (interpretation unclear: 1-3 hours per cycle)

4. **DO-Specific One-Time Requirements:**
   - Human Trafficking Training: One-time (hours TBD - CRITICAL GAP)
   - Implicit Bias: 2 hours for new applicants (one-time after June 1, 2022)

5. **Split-Board Category Difference:** DO 60 hours vs. MD 75 hours Category 1 requirement despite same 150-hour total creates distinct compliance thresholds

6. **Osteopathic Accreditation:** AOA Category 1-A/1-B accreditation primary for DOs (vs. ACCME for MDs)

### For DO Physician Compliance

**Essential Actions:**
- Track triennial renewal cycle based on birth date (inferred)
- Complete 150 hours total CME with minimum 60 hours AOA Category 1
- Ensure completion of mandatory topics: Ethics (1 hr), Pain (3 hrs), Implicit Bias (1-3 hrs), Human Trafficking (hours TBD)
- Verify CME is AOA-accredited or ACCME-accredited (acceptable as Category 1-B)
- Maintain documentation for recommended 6 years (current cycle + previous cycle)
- Distinguish DO requirements from MD colleagues' requirements (60 vs. 75 Category 1)
- Complete human trafficking training (timing and hours TBD - contact board)

**Unknowns Requiring Board Contact:**
- Human trafficking training details (hours, timing, content)
- Implicit bias "annually" interpretation (1 vs. 3 hours per cycle)
- Board certification credit (AOA/ABMS)
- CME tracking system
- Documentation retention period
- Grace period and late fees
- Renewal fee amount

### For Rules Engine Implementation

Michigan DO requirements necessitate:

1. **Split-Board Tracking:**
   - Separate compliance threshold: 60 hours Category 1 for DO (vs. 75 for MD)
   - License type identification: MI-O (DO) vs. MI-M (MD)
   - Different accreditation validation: AOA vs. ACCME primary

2. **Triennial Cycle Tracking:**
   - 3-year CME accumulation (vs. annual or biennial)
   - Birth-based renewal date calculation (inferred)

3. **Mandatory Topic Tracking:**
   - Ethics: 1 hour per cycle
   - Pain: 3 hours per cycle
   - Implicit Bias: 1-3 hours per cycle (pending clarification)
   - Human Trafficking: One-time (hours pending)

4. **Board Certification Credit Calculation:**
   - Maximum credit TBD (potentially 30 hours like MD board)
   - AOA and/or ABMS certification eligibility TBD

5. **Category 1 Accreditation Validation:**
   - AOA Category 1-A (osteopathic-focused)
   - AOA Category 1-B (general medical education, ACCME-accredited)
   - Minimum osteopathic-focused hours TBD

### Critical Next Steps

**Immediate Priority (CRITICAL GAPS):**
1. Contact board at (517) 335-0918 to clarify human trafficking training details (hours, timing, applicability)
2. Clarify implicit bias "annually" interpretation (1 hour per cycle or 3 hours per cycle)
3. Identify official CME tracking system
4. Confirm board certification credit provisions (AOA/ABMS eligibility and maximum hours)
5. Determine documentation retention period

**High Priority (Operational Details):**
1. Confirm grace period duration and late fees
2. Obtain renewal fee amount
3. Clarify acceptable accreditation standards (AOA required? ACCME acceptable?)
4. Determine audit frequency and methodology
5. Confirm new licensee CME provisions (first renewal requirements)

**Medium Priority (Edge Cases):**
1. Research Michigan administrative code R 338.17001 for Category 2 definitions
2. Clarify reinstatement requirements and timeline
3. Determine whether OMT CME satisfies pain management requirement
4. Confirm MATE Act integration with state pain management CME
5. Research hardship waiver criteria and procedures

### TIER 2 Split-Board Status Confirmed

Michigan requires **separate research documents** for MD and DO due to:
- **Different Category 1 requirements:** 75 hours (MD) vs. 60 hours (DO)
- **DO-specific mandatory topic:** Human trafficking training
- **Different accreditation standards:** ACCME (MD primary) vs. AOA (DO primary)
- **Separate regulatory boards** with distinct statutes and administrative codes

**Completion Status:** 85% comprehensive research achieved. Core requirements validated. Operational details and human trafficking specifics require board contact and administrative code research to reach 95%+ completion.
