## BATCH SUMMARY & COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS

### Overall Scores

| State | Score | Level | Frontmatter | Sections | Evidence | Sources | Gaps | Split-Board |
|-------|-------|-------|-------------|----------|----------|---------|------|-------------|
| **FL** | 79/100 | FAIR | 19/25 | 19/20 | 16/25 | 10/15 | 10/10 | 5/5 ✅ |
| **GA** | 74/100 | FAIR | 7/25 | 20/20 | 18/25 | 14/15 | 10/10 | 5/5 |

| **KY** | 77/100 | FAIR | 12/25 | 20/20 | 18/25 | 15/15 | 10/10 | 5/5 |
| **AVG** | **76.2** | **FAIR** | **9.8** | **19.7** | **18.0** | **13.7** | **10.0** | **5.0** |

### Key Findings

**Strengths:**
1. ✅ **Section Completeness:** All 6 states have complete section structure (avg 19.7/20)
2. ✅ **Gap Documentation:** All 6 states document gaps systematically (perfect 10/10 across batch)
3. ✅ **Evidence Classification:** All states use [FACT], [INFERENCE], [CRITICAL GAP] tags extensively
4. ✅ **Source Citations:** All states have comprehensive source sections with URLs
5. ✅ **Florida Split-Board:** Exemplary MD vs DO comparison table (perfect 5/5)

**Weaknesses:**
1. ❌ **Frontmatter Structure:** Major deficit across all 6 states (avg 9.8/25 = 39%)
   - Missing: governance, SOC2, ISO, scope, gap arrays
   - Only Florida has substantial frontmatter (19/25)
2. ❌ **Verbatim Quotes:** Across entire batch, <5% of [FACT - STATUTE] tags include verbatim quotes
3. ⚠️ **URLs:** Present in most states (GA/HI/ID/KS/KY), but Florida missing many URLs

### Pattern Analysis

**Frontmatter Issue:**
- GA, HI, ID, KS all score 7/25 (28%) on frontmatter
- All 4 states have ONLY basic metadata (state, license_type, tier, dates, completion %)
- All 4 missing: governance, SOC2, ISO, scope, gap arrays
- **This suggests a template issue or incomplete v3.0 frontmatter implementation**

**Florida Exception:**
- FL scores 19/25 on frontmatter (76%) - significantly better
- FL has: governance, SOC2, scope, research_quality sections
- FL missing: ISO standards, frontmatter gap arrays
- **FL closer to v3.0 compliance in frontmatter structure**

**Evidence Quality:**
- All states excellent at [FACT] tag usage
- All states good at providing URLs (except FL needs improvement)
- **NONE of the 6 states consistently include verbatim quotes** (0-5% rate)
- This is a systematic gap across entire batch

### Compliance Level Assessment

**All 6 states: FAIR (70-84%)**
- None reached GOOD (85-89%) threshold
- Florida closest at 79%
- Georgia lowest at 74%
- **Average: 76.2%**

**To Reach GOOD (85%):**
- All states need +18 pts from complete frontmatter
- All states need +5 pts from verbatim quotes
- These two fixes alone would bring all states to 85-90% range

## CRITICAL RECOMMENDATIONS

### For Research Team

**1. Standardize v3.0 Frontmatter Template (URGENT)**

Create required frontmatter template and apply to all v3.0 documents:
```yaml
---
state_abbr: "XX"
state_name: "StateName"
tier: "TIER-X"
license_type: "MD"
research_date: "YYYY-MM-DD"
last_verified: "YYYY-MM-DD"
researcher: "Name"
completion_percentage: XX
status: "COMPREHENSIVE"
version: "3.0"

governance:
  framework: "State Medical Board Regulatory Framework"
  authority_level: "STATE"
  primary_statute: "[Extract from research]"
  administrative_code: "[Extract from research]"

soc2_compliance:
  scope: "Renewal requirements research document"
  data_classification: "Public (regulatory information)"
  version_control: "Git-tracked markdown"
  change_management: "Updated when regulations change"
  audit_trail: "Research methodology documented"

iso_standards:
  applicable_standards:
    - "ISO 9001:2015 (Quality management)"
    - "ISO 27001:2022 (Information security)"
  documentation_standard: "ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010"
  approval_status: "APPROVED"

research_quality:
  completeness_percentage: XX
  validation_level: "COMPREHENSIVE"
  source_count_minimum: "2 per requirement"
  source_hierarchy_applied: true
  cross_source_congruency_tracked: true

scope:
  included:
    - "License renewal frequency and deadlines"
    - "CME requirements (hours, categories, topics)"
    - [Add state-specific items]
  excluded:
    - "Initial licensing exam requirements"
    - "Medical school accreditation standards"
    - "Disciplinary procedures"

critical_gaps: []
high_gaps: []
medium_gaps: []
---
```

**2. Add Verbatim Quote Requirement to Research Process**

For every [FACT - STATUTE] or [FACT - ADMIN_CODE] tag, require:
```
[FACT - STATUTE] Requirement description.

Citation: [Full citation]
Source: [URL]
Quote: "[Exact verbatim text from statute/regulation]"
Last Verified: [Date]
```

**3. Florida-Specific: Complete Frontmatter and Add URLs**

Florida is closest to GOOD threshold and should be prioritized:
- Add ISO standards section (+3 pts)
- Add frontmatter gap arrays (+3 pts)
- Add URLs to all citations (+6 pts)
- **Result: 79 → 91 (EXCELLENT)**
