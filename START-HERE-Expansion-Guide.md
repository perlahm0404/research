2. **Kentucky Administrative Regulations (KAR)**
   - URL: https://www.lrc.ky.gov/kar/TITLE201.HTM
   - Find: 201 KAR (Board of Medical Licensure regulations)
   - Search for: CME audit procedures

3. **Kentucky Board of Medical Licensure Website**
   - URL: https://kbml.ky.gov/
   - Navigate to: "Licensure" → "Renewal" → "CME Requirements"
