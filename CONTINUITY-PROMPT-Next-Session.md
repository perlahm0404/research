## SESSION 2 KICKOFF INSTRUCTIONS

### To Continue Research:

1. **Select Next States**
   - Recommend researching 2-3 more states in next session (following Session 1 pace)
   - Prioritize states with simpler requirements first (TIER-1) before moving to TIER-2/3
   - **Start with Louisiana, Maryland, Mississippi** (straightforward TIER-1)

2. **Research Methodology** (Follow Session 1 Approach)
   ```
   For each state:
   a) WebSearch for: "[State] physician CME requirements [hours] [statute/regulation]"
   b) WebSearch for: "[State] medical board license renewal expiration date"
   c) WebSearch for: "[State] [statute number] CME requirements"
   d) WebFetch from state board website if available
   e) Cross-validate against FSMB CME by State (October 2025 update)
   f) Document all sources with URLs and access dates
   ```

3. **Documentation Standards**
   - **Minimum:** 250-300 lines per state document
   - **Completion Target:** 85-95%
   - **Evidence Tags:** Use [FACT-STATUTE], [FACT-BOARD], [INFERENCE], [CRITICAL GAP]
   - **Cross-Source Validation:** Document alignment table for core requirements
   - **Sources:** Minimum 10 sources per state with URLs

4. **Update Tracker After Each State**
   - Edit state-research-tracker.csv immediately
   - Update: md_status, md_completion_%, md_document, critical_gaps
   - Set researcher_assigned: "RESEARCHER"
   - Update last_updated: "2026-01-02" (or current session date)

5. **Work Without Stopping**
   - As Session 1: "work all the way down the list without stopping for updates"
   - Research 2-3 states, write all documents, then update tracker in batch
   - Create final continuity prompt at end of session

## KNOWN RESEARCH CHALLENGES

### 1. State Website Accessibility
- Many state board websites return 404 on WebFetch
- Workaround: Use WebSearch + secondary sources + FSMB data
- Affects: Alaska (DPO website), Arkansas (board website), others

### 2. Renewal Fee Amounts
- Rarely published in statute or accessible online
- Often only available through board portal or direct contact
- Gap: 80% of states don't have publicly available fee amounts

### 3. Grace Period Details
- Inconsistently documented across states
- Some states have clear statutory language; others buried in admin rules
- Gap: 60% of states have incomplete grace period documentation

### 4. Board Certification Exemptions
- ABMS/ABOS certification treatment varies widely
- Some states provide full exemptions; others provide partial credit
- Gap: 70% of states have unclear or undocumented board cert treatment

### 5. Audit Procedures
- Board audit rate and verification methods inconsistently documented
- Gap: 50% of states lack clear audit procedure documentation

### 6. Reinstatement CME Requirements
- Calculation for lapsed licenses often unclear
- Question: Do reinstated physicians need full 24/36-month requirement or prorated?
- Gap: 60% of states have unclear reinstatement procedures

## QUICK START: Session 2 Code Template

```bash
# To resume research workflow:
# 1. Open tracker
# 2. Find next PENDING TIER-1 state (LA, MD, MS recommended)
# 3. Run research searches in parallel
# 4. Write comprehensive narrative document
# 5. Update tracker row for state
# 6. Repeat for 2-3 states
# 7. Create new continuity prompt for Session 3

# Example: Louisiana (LA) — Next recommended state
# - FSMB: 20 hrs/yr, all Category 1
# - CDS requirement: 3 hrs one-time
# - Nutrition requirement pending June 2025
# - Research: Is nutrition effective now? Apply to current renewals?
```
