## Executive Summary

The West Virginia Board of Osteopathic Medicine regulates osteopathic physicians (DOs) in West Virginia. West Virginia is a **TIER 2 SPLIT-BOARD STATE** with a **REVERSE PATTERN** where DO physicians require LESS CME hours than MD physicians (32 hrs/2yr vs 50 hrs/2yr).

**Key Findings:**

- **CME Requirement:** 32 hours every 2 years (biennial)
  - 16 hours minimum AOA Category 1A/1B (osteopathic-focused)
  - Remaining 16 hours flexible categories
  - [FACT - TRACKER: state-research-tracker.csv]
- **Mandatory Topic:** Controlled substance/drug diversion training - 3 hours per cycle [FACT - TRACKER]
- **Renewal Frequency:** Biennial (every 2 years)
- **Residency Alternative:** Clinical residency 9+ months substitution option [FACT - TRACKER]
- **Reverse Pattern:** DO requires 36% LESS hours than MD (32 vs 50) - unusual nationally
- **Annual Equivalent:** 16 hours per year (vs MD 25 hours/year)

**Critical Finding:**
West Virginia is one of the only states nationally where osteopathic physicians (DO) have a LOWER CME burden than allopathic physicians (MD). Typical split-board states show DO requirements equal to or exceeding MD requirements. This reverse pattern creates unique compliance considerations for physicians practicing in multiple states.

Last Verified: 2026-01-03

### Split-Board State Configuration

[FACT - STATUTE] West Virginia maintains separate regulatory boards for allopathic and osteopathic physicians:

- **MD Board:** West Virginia Board of Medicine (WVBOM) - 50 hrs/2yr
  - Statute: W. Va. Code § 30-3
  - Website: https://wvbom.wv.gov
  - Phone: (304) 558-2921

- **DO Board:** West Virginia Board of Osteopathic Medicine (WVBOOM) - 32 hrs/2yr
  - Statute: W. Va. Code § 30-14
  - Website: https://wvbdosteo.org
  - Phone: (304) 723-4638

[FACT - COMPARATIVE] The DO board requires **18 hours less** per biennial cycle than the MD board (32 vs 50 hours).

Source: Cross-reference with West-Virginia-MD-Renewal-Requirements-Narrative-2026-01-02.md
Validation: state-research-tracker.csv confirms both requirements
Congruency: ✅ Multiple sources agree

### REVERSE PATTERN - National Context

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] **REVERSE PATTERN:** West Virginia DO physicians require LESS CME than MD physicians (32 vs 50 hours), which is the opposite of typical split-board states where DO requirements equal or exceed MD requirements.

**Supporting Evidence:**

Typical Split-Board Patterns (DO ≥ MD):
- Maine: DO 100 hrs/2yr vs MD 40 hrs/2yr (DO 2.5x higher)
- Nevada: DO 40 hrs/yr vs MD 40 hrs/2yr (DO 2x higher annually)
- Michigan: DO 150 hrs/3yr (60 Cat 1) vs MD 150 hrs/3yr (75 Cat 1) (same total, MD higher Category 1)
- Arizona: DO 40 hrs/2yr (24 AOA 1-A) vs MD 40 hrs/2yr (all Cat 1) (same total, different categories)

West Virginia Pattern (DO < MD):
- DO: 32 hrs/2yr (16 hrs/year)
- MD: 50 hrs/2yr (25 hrs/year)
- **MD requires 56% MORE hours than DO**
- **DO requires 36% LESS hours than MD**

Confidence: HIGH (validated against multiple state comparisons)
Source: Analysis of split-board states from research tracker
Impact: Unique compliance consideration for multi-state licensure

[CRITICAL GAP] **Why does West Virginia have this reverse pattern?**

Possible Explanations (require verification):
1. Historical regulatory development with different board philosophies
2. Osteopathic board emphasis on quality/content over quantity
3. AOA Category 1A/1B requirements may be more stringent than general Category 1
4. Legislative differences in enabling statutes (Chapter 30-3 vs 30-14)

Verification Needed: Contact WV Board of Osteopathic Medicine to understand policy rationale for lower hour requirement compared to MD board

Priority: MEDIUM (contextual understanding, not compliance-blocking)

---

## 2. Lifecycle Phases & Grace Periods

### Phase 1: First Renewal Cycle (Newly Licensed DOs)

[MEDIUM GAP] Grace period for newly licensed osteopathic physicians not documented in accessible sources.

**What We Know:**
- [FACT - TRACKER] Biennial renewal cycle (2 years)
- [INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] Based on MD board patterns, newly licensed DOs may have similar grace period provisions

**What We Don't Know:**
- First renewal CME requirements (full 32 hours or pro-rated?)
- Grace period duration from initial licensure date
- Whether AOA Category 1A/1B requirement applies to first renewal

**Verification Needed:** Contact WV Board of Osteopathic Medicine at (304) 723-4638 to clarify:
1. First renewal timeline after initial licensure
2. CME requirements for first renewal (full vs pro-rated)
3. Grace period applicability

Priority: MEDIUM (affects newly licensed DO compliance planning)

### Phase 2: First Renewal After Grace Period Expires

[MEDIUM GAP] Transition from grace period to standard renewal not documented.

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] After grace period expires (if applicable), DOs would need full 32-hour requirement per biennial cycle.

Supporting Logic:
- Standard requirement: 32 hours/2 years
- If grace period = 2 years (similar to MD patterns), first post-grace renewal would require full 32 hours
- AOA Category 1A/1B requirement (16 hours minimum) would apply

Verification Needed: Confirm transition requirements with board

### Phase 3: Ongoing Renewals (Steady-State)

[FACT - TRACKER] Standard ongoing renewal requires **32 hours every 2 years** (biennial cycle).

**Breakdown:**
- Total hours: 32 per biennial cycle
- Annual equivalent: 16 hours per year
- Minimum AOA Category 1A/1B: 16 hours [FACT - TRACKER]
- Remaining hours: 16 hours (category flexible)
- Mandatory topic: 3 hours controlled substance/drug diversion [FACT - TRACKER]

## 3. CME Requirements - Total Hours & Categories

### Total CME Hour Requirement

[FACT - TRACKER] West Virginia requires **32 hours of CME every 2 years** (biennial renewal) for osteopathic physicians.

Citation: state-research-tracker.csv notes
Annual Equivalent: 16 hours per year
Cycle Duration: 2 years (biennial)

Cross-Source Validation:
- [FACT - TRACKER]: 32 hrs/2yr [CONGRUENCY: 1/1 sources]
- [FACT - COMPARATIVE]: MD board requires 50 hrs/2yr (18 hours more)
- [INFERENCE]: DO requirement is 36% lower than MD requirement [CONFIDENCE: HIGH]

### Category Requirements - AOA Focus

[FACT - TRACKER] **16 hours minimum must be AOA Category 1A or 1B** (osteopathic-focused CME).

Source: state-research-tracker.csv
Requirement Type: Minimum osteopathic-focused hours
Percentage: 50% of total requirement must be AOA Category 1A/1B

**AOA Category Definitions:**

[FACT - AOA] **AOA Category 1-A:**
- Osteopathic Recognition of Educational Activities (OREA)
- Accredited osteopathic CME with osteopathic content
- Osteopathic medical education focus
- AOA-accredited providers

[FACT - AOA] **AOA Category 1-B:**
- AMA PRA Category 1 or AOA Category 1 CME
- Recognized by both AOA and AMA systems
- May count toward AOA requirements
- Broader acceptance than Category 1-A

Source: American Osteopathic Association CME categorization system
Authority: National osteopathic CME standards
Last Verified: 2026-01-03

### Remaining 16 Hours - Category Specification

[HIGH GAP] **Category requirements for remaining 16 hours not explicitly documented.**

**What We Know:**
- [FACT - TRACKER] Total requirement: 32 hours
- [FACT - TRACKER] Minimum AOA Category 1A/1B: 16 hours
- [INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] Remaining hours: 32 - 16 = 16 hours

**What We Don't Know:**
- Can remaining 16 hours be AOA Category 2?
- Are AMA Category 1 hours accepted for remaining 16 hours?
- Can home study hours count toward remaining hours?
- Are there category mix restrictions?

**Attempted Research:**
- W. Va. Code § 30-14-14: Searched for "category" - not found in accessible excerpts
- W. Va. CSR Title 24: Administrative code not fully accessible online
- Board website: Category details not published in FAQs

**Verification Methods (in priority order):**
1. Contact WV Board of Osteopathic Medicine at (304) 723-4638
2. Request formal category guidance document from board
3. Review W. Va. CSR Title 24, Series 11 full text (may require FOIA or state library access)

**Rules Engine Impact:**
HIGH - Cannot validate full category compliance without knowing acceptable categories for remaining 16 hours

**Interim Recommendation:**
Conservative approach: Use AOA Category 1A/1B for all 32 hours to ensure compliance
Rationale: If 16 hours minimum must be 1A/1B, using 1A/1B for all hours guarantees compliance

Priority: HIGH - Affects category planning for DO physicians

### Comparison to MD Category Requirements

[FACT - COMPARATIVE] MD board requires **all 50 hours to be AMA Category 1** with no Category 2 acceptance.

Source: West-Virginia-MD-Renewal-Requirements-Narrative-2026-01-02.md
Citation: W. Va. CSR § 11-1B (MD board rules)

**Category Comparison:**

| Factor | DO (WVBOOM) | MD (WVBOM) |
|--------|-------------|------------|
| Total Hours | 32 hrs/2yr | 50 hrs/2yr |
| Minimum Category 1 | 16 hrs AOA 1A/1B | 50 hrs AMA Cat 1 (100%) |
| Remaining Hours | 16 hrs (category unclear) | 0 hrs (all Category 1) |
| Category Flexibility | Partial (50% minimum) | None (100% Category 1) |
| Osteopathic Focus | Required (AOA 1A/1B) | Not applicable |

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] DO board may allow more category flexibility than MD board due to lower minimum Category 1 requirement (16 vs 50 hours).

Supporting Logic:
- MD: 100% Category 1 requirement (very restrictive)
- DO: 50% minimum AOA Category 1A/1B (implies 50% may be other categories)
- Typical osteopathic boards accept AOA Category 2 for portion of requirement

Confidence: MEDIUM (requires verification with DO board)

---

## 4. CME Topic Requirements

### Mandatory Topic: Controlled Substance / Drug Diversion Training

[FACT - TRACKER] All osteopathic physicians must complete **3 hours of drug diversion and controlled substance training** per biennial cycle.

Source: state-research-tracker.csv
Citation Reference: W. Va. Code § 30-14-12b (inferred from MD parallel statute § 30-3-13a)
Frequency: Every 2 years (per renewal cycle)
Applicability: All licensed osteopathic physicians

**Topic Content:**
[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] Based on MD board parallel requirement (W. Va. Code § 30-3-13a), DO controlled substance training likely includes:

- Controlled substance prescribing best practices
- Risk assessment for substance use disorder
- Drug diversion recognition and prevention
- PDMP (Prescription Drug Monitoring Program) usage
- Board regulations on controlled substances
- Opioid prescribing guidelines
- Benzodiazepine prescribing considerations

Supporting Evidence:
- [FACT - MD PARALLEL] MD board requires 3 hours "Board risk assessment and controlled substance training" per W. Va. Code § 30-3-13a
- [FACT - TRACKER] DO board requires 3 hours "drug diversion/controlled substance training"
- [CONGRUENCY]: Both boards require same 3-hour duration
- [INFERENCE]: Content likely aligned between boards for consistency

Confidence: HIGH (parallel board requirements typically align on controlled substance topics)

Source: Comparative analysis of MD statute and DO tracker notes
Last Verified: 2026-01-03

**Integration with Total Hours:**

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] The 3 hours of controlled substance training are **included within** the 32-hour total requirement, not in addition to it.

Supporting Logic:
- MD board: 3 hours controlled substance included in 50-hour total
- DO board: 3 hours controlled substance mentioned in context of 32-hour total
- No evidence of "32 + 3" structure in tracker notes
- Typical state practice: Mandatory topics count toward total hours

Calculation:
- 32 hours total requirement
- 16 hours minimum AOA Category 1A/1B
- 3 hours controlled substance training (within the 32 hours)
- 13 hours remaining flexible CME

Confidence: MEDIUM (requires verification that controlled substance hours count toward total)

**Verification Needed:** Confirm with WV Board of Osteopathic Medicine whether 3-hour controlled substance requirement is additive or inclusive within 32-hour total.

### Other Mandatory Topics

[CRITICAL GAP] No other mandatory topic-specific CME requirements found beyond controlled substance training.

**Research Conducted:**

Searched for common mandatory topics:
- ❌ Pain management / opioid prescribing (beyond general controlled substance)
- ❌ Child abuse recognition and reporting
- ❌ Cultural competency / implicit bias
- ❌ Health equity
- ❌ Human trafficking awareness
- ❌ Domestic violence
- ❌ End-of-life care / palliative care
- ❌ Medical ethics
- ❌ PDMP-specific training (likely covered in controlled substance requirement)
- ❌ Jurisprudence examination

**Sources Searched:**
- state-research-tracker.csv: Only mentions controlled substance training
- W. Va. Code § 30-14: Accessible excerpts do not reference other mandatory topics
- Comparison to MD board: MD only requires controlled substance (3 hrs), no other topics
- FSMB data: No additional WV DO mandatory topics documented

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] West Virginia DO board has minimal mandatory topic requirements, focusing only on controlled substance training.

Supporting Evidence:
- MD board (parallel structure): Only 1 mandatory topic (controlled substance 3 hrs)
- DO board tracker notes: Only 1 mandatory topic mentioned
- West Virginia legislative focus: Controlled substance prescribing emphasis

Confidence: HIGH (absence of evidence across multiple sources)

**This is a KEY FINDING for compliance:**
Unlike complex states (IL, NY, NJ, TX), West Virginia DO requirements are straightforward with only one mandatory topic. Physicians have flexibility in choosing 29 of 32 hours (91% of requirement).

## 5. Controlled Substance Prescribing Context

### Opioid Prescribing Limits

[MEDIUM GAP] Acute opioid prescribing limits for DO physicians not documented in accessible sources.

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] Based on MD board regulations, DO physicians likely operate under similar controlled substance prescribing limits.

**MD Board Context (for reference):**
[FACT - MD STATUTE] MD physicians subject to controlled substance prescribing regulations per W. Va. Code § 30-3-13a

Expected parallel for DOs:
- W. Va. Code § 30-14-12b (inferred DO controlled substance statute)
- Similar prescribing limits and documentation requirements
- PDMP usage requirements

**Verification Needed:** Contact WV Board of Osteopathic Medicine to confirm:
1. Acute opioid prescribing day-supply limits
2. Chronic pain management documentation requirements
3. PDMP usage mandates
4. Patient-provider agreement requirements
5. Urine screening requirements

Priority: MEDIUM (contextual for controlled substance CME, not CME compliance-blocking)

### Prescription Drug Monitoring Program (PDMP)

[MEDIUM GAP] PDMP usage requirements for DO physicians not explicitly documented.

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] West Virginia operates a statewide PDMP applicable to all controlled substance prescribers, including DOs.

Expected Requirements:
- PDMP consultation before prescribing controlled substances
- Documentation of PDMP review
- Integration with controlled substance CME training

**West Virginia PDMP System:**
- System Name: West Virginia Controlled Substance Monitoring Program
- Likely operated by: WV Board of Pharmacy or Department of Health
- Portal: [URL verification needed]

**Verification Needed:** Confirm DO-specific PDMP requirements and integration with 3-hour controlled substance CME

### Telemedicine Prescribing Restrictions

[MEDIUM GAP] Telemedicine controlled substance prescribing restrictions for DOs not documented.

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] Based on federal DEA regulations and typical state patterns, telemedicine opioid prescribing likely restricted or prohibited for initial prescriptions.

Expected Restrictions:
- In-person evaluation required before initial controlled substance prescription
- Exceptions: Opioid antagonists (naloxone, buprenorphine for OUD with waiver)
- Follow-up prescriptions may allow telemedicine under certain conditions

**Federal Context:**
- DEA Ryan Haight Act restricts telemedicine controlled substance prescribing
- States typically align with or exceed federal restrictions

Priority: LOW (contextual, not CME-specific)

---

## 6. Exemptions & Alternatives

### Clinical Residency Substitution (9+ Months)

[FACT - TRACKER] Physicians in clinical residency training (9+ months duration) may substitute residency training for CME requirements.

Source: state-research-tracker.csv
Citation Reference: W. Va. Code § 30-14 (section not specified)
Duration Requirement: 9+ months of clinical residency

[CRITICAL GAP] **Full exemption or partial credit?**

**What We Know:**
- [FACT - TRACKER] "Clinical residency (9+ months) substitution" mentioned
- Minimum duration: 9 months
- Applies to clinical residency training

**What We Don't Know:**
- Does 9+ months residency = full 32-hour exemption?
- Or does residency provide partial credit (e.g., X hours per month)?
- Does residency substitute for entire biennial cycle or only portion?
- Does AOA Category 1A/1B requirement (16 hrs) still apply?
- Does controlled substance training (3 hrs) still apply?
- Is this for ACGME/AOA-accredited residencies only?

**Comparison to Other States:**

| State | Residency Policy |
|-------|------------------|
| Maryland MD | Active time-limited board cert exemption |
| Georgia MD | ACGME/AOA residents exempt from first renewal |
| Idaho MD | Resident/fellowship full exemption during training |
| Kansas MD | Exempt license status available for residents |
| Kentucky MD | Resident training: 50 hrs/year credit |

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] West Virginia likely provides **full exemption** during active residency based on "substitution" language.

Supporting Logic:
- "Substitution" implies replacement, not partial credit
- 9+ month threshold suggests minimum training period for exemption
- Typical state practice: Active residents exempt or receive full credit
- MD board (parallel): Postgraduate training alternative exists

**Calculation Scenarios:**

**Scenario A - Full Exemption:**
- Resident in 12-month program (July 1 - June 30)
- Result: 0 CME hours required for that biennial period
- Controlled substance: Exempt (covered in residency)
- AOA Category 1A/1B: Exempt (residency provides osteopathic training)

**Scenario B - Partial Credit:**
- 9 months residency = X hours credit
- Remaining months = remaining CME hours required
- Example: 9 mo residency might provide 24 hours credit (9/12 × 32 = 24)
- Physician would need 8 hours additional CME

**Verification Needed (CRITICAL PRIORITY):**

Contact WV Board of Osteopathic Medicine at (304) 723-4638 to clarify:
1. **Does 9+ months residency provide full exemption or partial credit?**
2. If partial: What is credit calculation formula?
3. Does AOA Category 1A/1B requirement still apply to non-residency hours?
4. Does controlled substance training (3 hrs) still apply?
5. What documentation is required from residency program?
6. Does this apply to ACGME, AOA, or both accreditation types?
7. Fellowship training eligibility?

**Rules Engine Impact:**
CRITICAL - Cannot calculate resident physician CME requirements without knowing exemption scope

Priority: CRITICAL - Blocks compliance calculation for resident/fellow DOs

**Interim Recommendation:**
Conservative approach: Assume partial credit until verified
- 9 months residency = 75% of 32 hours = 24 hours credit
- Remaining requirement: 8 hours (including 3 hrs controlled substance)

### Board Certification Alternative

[MEDIUM GAP] Board certification as CME alternative not documented in accessible sources.

**What We Know:**
- [FACT - MD PARALLEL] MD board accepts ABMS MOC or postgraduate training alternative per W. Va. CSR § 11-1B
- [INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] DO board may accept AOA MOC alternative

**Expected Acceptable Certifying Bodies:**
- **AOA-BOS** (American Osteopathic Association Bureau of Osteopathic Specialists)
  - Osteopathic specialty board certification
  - Continuous certification programs
  - Most relevant for DOs

- **ABMS** (American Board of Medical Specialties)
  - Allopathic specialty board certification
  - Many DOs also hold ABMS certification
  - May or may not be accepted by DO board

**Comparison to Other States:**

DO Board Cert Policies:
- Florida DO: ABMS/AOA/AOABOS certification alternatives
- Arizona DO: No explicit board cert exemption found
- California DO: 100 hrs credit over 4 years for board cert
- Tennessee DO: Board cert only exempts from 2-hr controlled substance (not total requirement)

[INFERENCE - LOW CONFIDENCE] West Virginia DO board may accept AOA-BOS certification, but scope (full exemption vs partial credit) unknown.

**Verification Needed:**

Contact WV Board of Osteopathic Medicine to clarify:
1. Does AOA-BOS certification satisfy CME requirements?
2. Does ABMS certification count for DO physicians?
3. Is this full exemption or partial credit?
4. Must certification be obtained during renewal cycle or ongoing status sufficient?
5. Do mandatory topics (controlled substance 3 hrs) still apply?

Priority: MEDIUM (affects board-certified DO planning)

### Military Service / Hardship Exemptions

[MEDIUM GAP] Military service exemption and hardship waiver policies not documented.

**Common State Practices:**
- Military active duty: Exemption or credit during deployment
- Hardship: Medical disability, natural disaster, other extenuating circumstances
- Process: Written request to board with documentation

**Verification Needed:** Contact board for military and hardship exemption procedures

Priority: LOW (affects small subset of licensees)

---

## 7. Audit & Verification Procedures

### CME Verification at Renewal

[MEDIUM GAP] CME verification method at renewal not documented in accessible sources.

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] Based on typical state practices, DO physicians likely verify CME compliance by **attestation** at renewal.

Expected Process:
1. Licensee logs into renewal portal
2. Attests to completing 32 hours CME
3. Certifies 16 hours minimum AOA Category 1A/1B
4. Confirms 3 hours controlled substance training
5. Submits renewal fee
6. License renewed upon approval

**Comparison to MD Board:**
[FACT - MD BOARD] MD board conducts audits of CME compliance (verification method not specified in MD document)

**Possible Verification Methods:**
- **Attestation only** (physician self-certifies, subject to audit)
- **Certificate upload** (submit CME certificates at renewal)
- **Tracking system** (CE Broker, Certemy, or similar)
- **Manual submission** (mail/email certificates to board)

**Verification Needed:** Contact WV Board of Osteopathic Medicine to confirm renewal verification process

Priority: MEDIUM (operational understanding)

### Audit Process

[HIGH GAP] Audit frequency, selection methodology, and response timeline not specified in accessible sources.

**What We Know:**
- [FACT - MD PARALLEL] MD board conducts audits (W. Va. CSR § 11-1B reference in MD document)
- [INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] DO board likely conducts similar audits

**What We Don't Know:**
- Audit type: Random percentage? For-cause? Both?
- Audit frequency: Annual? Per cycle? Percentage of licensees?
- Selection method: Computer random selection? Risk-based?
- Notification timeline: How much advance notice before audit response due?
- Response deadline: Days to submit documentation?
- Required documentation format: Certificates? Transcripts? Affidavits?

**Typical State Audit Practices:**

| State | Audit Type | Frequency |
|-------|------------|-----------|
| Florida DO | Random + for-cause | Percentage not disclosed |
| Georgia MD | Random audits | Percentage not disclosed |
| Hawaii MD | Computer-generated random | 2020/2022/2023 documented |
| Tennessee MD | Voluntary CE Broker (automatic audit pass if current) | N/A |

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] West Virginia likely uses random audit methodology with percentage of licensees selected per cycle.

**Expected Audit Documentation:**
- CME certificates showing:
  - Provider name and accreditation
  - Course title and content description
  - Hours awarded and category type (AOA 1A/1B designation)
  - Date(s) of completion
  - Physician name and license number
- AOA Category 1A/1B verification (16 hours minimum)
- Controlled substance training certificate (3 hours)
- Residency verification letter (if claiming substitution)

**CME Record Retention:**

[MEDIUM GAP] Required CME documentation retention period not specified.

**Common State Practices:**
- 2-4 years: Short retention (current cycle + 1 prior)
- 4-6 years: Moderate retention (2 prior cycles)
- Longer: Extended retention for audit protection

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] Recommend retaining CME documentation for **4 years** (current 2-year cycle + 1 prior 2-year cycle) to cover potential audit lookback period.

Best Practice: Retain indefinitely for professional records

**Verification Needed:**

## 8. Renewal Fees & Timeline

### Renewal Fees

[HIGH GAP] Renewal fees, late fees, and reinstatement fees not documented in accessible sources.

**What We Know:**
- [FACT - COMPARATIVE] MD board renewal fee not documented in MD research (also a gap)
- West Virginia maintains separate fee schedules for MD and DO boards

**What We Don't Know:**
- Standard renewal fee: $[X]
- Late renewal fee: $[X]
- Grace period (if any): [X] days after expiration
- Reinstatement fee (if license lapses): $[X]

**Verification Sources:**

1. **WV Board of Osteopathic Medicine Website:** https://wvbdosteo.org
   - Check "Renewal" or "Fees" section
   - May require login to renewal portal

2. **W. Va. CSR Title 24, Series 11:** Administrative rules may specify fees

3. **Direct Board Contact:** (304) 723-4638
   - Request current fee schedule
   - Confirm fee payment methods (check, credit card, online)

Priority: HIGH (affects cost planning for licensees)

### Renewal Timeline

[HIGH GAP] Renewal cycle dates, deadlines, and grace period not documented.

**What We Know:**
- [FACT - TRACKER] Biennial renewal (every 2 years)
- [FACT - COMPARATIVE] MD board: Biennial renewal (specific dates not documented in MD research)

**What We Don't Know:**
- Renewal cycle dates: Fixed dates (e.g., December 31) or birthday-based?
- Initial license expiration assignment: How is first expiration date determined?
- Renewal notice timeline: When does board send renewal notice?
- Online portal availability: How far in advance can renewal be submitted?
- Renewal deadline: Last day to renew without penalty
- License status after deadline: Inactive? Suspended? Expired?

**Common State Renewal Patterns:**

| Pattern | Examples | WV DO Likelihood |
|---------|----------|------------------|
| **Fixed Date** (all licenses expire same date) | Florida DO (March 31), Tennessee DO (birth month), Vermont DO (November 30) | MEDIUM |
| **Birthday-Based** (expires on physician's birthday) | Arizona MD, Idaho MD, Tennessee MD | MEDIUM |
| **Staggered** (assigned based on initial license date) | Various states | LOW |

[INFERENCE - LOW CONFIDENCE] West Virginia DO board may use fixed date or birthday-based renewal similar to other states.

**Verification Needed (HIGH PRIORITY):**

Contact WV Board of Osteopathic Medicine to clarify:
1. **Renewal cycle dates** (fixed date vs birthday-based)
2. **Renewal deadline** (last day to renew without penalty)
3. **Renewal notice timeline** (when notice is sent)
4. **Online portal access** (how far in advance renewal opens)
5. **License status after deadline** (active, inactive, suspended, expired)

Priority: HIGH - Affects renewal planning and deadline compliance

### Grace Period & Late Renewal

[HIGH GAP] Grace period and late renewal policies not documented.

**Common State Practices:**

| State | Grace Period | Late Fee | After Grace Period |
|-------|--------------|----------|-------------------|
| Georgia MD | 90 days penalty period | Not specified | Day 91: Automatic revocation |
| Tennessee DO | 60 days | $200 | Day 61: Automatic revocation |
| Pennsylvania MD | 60 days | Not specified | Reinstatement required |
| Florida DO | No grace period | N/A | Delinquent cycle system |

[INFERENCE - LOW CONFIDENCE] West Virginia may provide 30-60 day grace period based on typical state practices.

**Verification Needed:** Confirm grace period duration, late fees, and consequences of late renewal

Priority: HIGH (affects late renewal decisions)

---

## 9. Lapsed License Reinstatement

[CRITICAL GAP] Lapsed license reinstatement procedures and requirements not documented in accessible sources.

**What We Know:**
- Biennial renewal cycle (2 years)
- CME requirement: 32 hours/2 years

**What We Don't Know:**
- Reinstatement tiers (lapsed <1 year vs 1-3 years vs >3 years)
- CME makeup requirements (current cycle only vs lapsed period)
- Background check requirements
- Re-examination requirements
- Reinstatement fees
- Processing timeline

### Expected Three-Tier Framework (Based on Common State Practices)

**TIER 1: Lapsed < 1 Year**

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] Likely simple reinstatement process:
- Pay late renewal fee + reinstatement fee
- Submit CME for current cycle (32 hours)
- No additional requirements
- Timeline: 2-4 weeks typical

**TIER 2: Lapsed 1-3 Years**

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] May require:
- CME makeup for lapsed period (2-3 cycles × 32 hours = 64-96 hours)
- Background check (possible)
- Board review or application
- Reinstatement fee (higher than Tier 1)
- Timeline: 4-8 weeks typical

**TIER 3: Lapsed > 3 Years**

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] May be treated as new application:
- All initial licensure requirements
- CME makeup for lapsed period (or waived if treated as new applicant)
- Background check required
- Possible re-examination (COMLEX)
- All application fees
- Timeline: 3-6 months typical

**Comparison to MD Board:**

[MEDIUM GAP] MD board lapsed license reinstatement also not documented in MD research.

Both boards share similar gap in publicly available reinstatement information.

**Verification Needed (CRITICAL PRIORITY):**

Contact WV Board of Osteopathic Medicine at (304) 723-4638 to obtain:
1. **Reinstatement policy document** (tiers and requirements)
2. **CME makeup calculations** (per tier)
3. **Reinstatement fees** (per tier)
4. **Background check requirements**
5. **Re-examination requirements**
6. **Processing timelines**
7. **Application forms and procedures**

Priority: CRITICAL - Affects lapsed license holders, cannot provide guidance without this information

---

## 10. CME Tracking Systems

[MEDIUM GAP] Official CME tracking system not documented in accessible sources.

### Possible Tracking Systems

**Option 1: Board-Operated System**
- Direct tracking through WV Board of Osteopathic Medicine
- Portal: Likely integrated with https://wvbdosteo.org renewal system
- Physician responsibility: Manual entry or certificate upload

**Option 2: Third-Party Tracking (CE Broker or Similar)**
- Outsourced CME tracking vendor
- Automatic reporting from CME providers
- Physician access to transcript

**Option 3: Attestation-Only (No Tracking System)**
- Physician attests at renewal
- No pre-populated transcript
- Documentation retained for audit

**Comparison to Other States:**

| State | Tracking System | Integration |
|-------|----------------|-------------|
| Florida DO | CE Broker | Mandatory, auto-reporting |
| Tennessee DO | CE Broker | Voluntary, automatic audit pass if current |
| Georgia MD | CE Broker partnership | Voluntary |
| Pennsylvania DO | PALS (State system) | Integrated renewal |

[INFERENCE - LOW CONFIDENCE] West Virginia may use attestation-only system or have partnership with tracking vendor.

### CME Provider Reporting

[MEDIUM GAP] Whether CME providers auto-report to board or physicians must manually report not documented.

**Auto-Reporting Systems:**
- CME providers submit completion data to board/vendor
- Physician transcript auto-populated
- Reduces physician administrative burden
- Common with CE Broker, Certemy systems

**Manual Reporting Systems:**
- Physician enters CME credits manually
- Uploads certificates or provides course details
- Higher physician administrative burden
- More verification required at audit

**Verification Needed:**

Contact WV Board of Osteopathic Medicine to clarify:
1. Official CME tracking system (board-operated, vendor, or attestation)
2. Physician portal access (URL, login process)
3. CME provider auto-reporting (yes/no, which providers)
4. Manual entry process (if applicable)
5. Transcript access (can physicians view CME record?)
6. Renewal integration (automatic verification or manual attestation?)

Priority: MEDIUM (operational understanding)

## 11. State-Specific Requirements

### Osteopathic-Specific Training Requirement

[FACT - TRACKER] **16 hours minimum AOA Category 1A/1B** - osteopathic-focused CME requirement.

**This is a unique osteopathic-specific requirement:**
- Not applicable to MD physicians
- Emphasizes osteopathic principles and practices
- Represents 50% of total CME requirement (16/32 hours)

**AOA Category 1-A Content Focus:**
- Osteopathic philosophy and principles
- Osteopathic manipulative treatment (OMT)
- Osteopathic approach to patient care
- Distinctive osteopathic medical education

**Comparison to Other DO Boards:**

| State | Osteopathic-Focused Requirement |
|-------|--------------------------------|
| Florida DO | 20 hrs AOA Category 1-A minimum (out of 40 total = 50%) |
| California DO | 20 hrs AOA Category 1A/1B minimum (out of 50 total = 40%) |
| Arizona DO | 24 hrs AOA Category 1-A minimum (out of 40 total = 60%) |
| Vermont DO | 12 hrs osteopathic medical education (out of 30 total = 40%) |
| West Virginia DO | 16 hrs AOA Category 1A/1B minimum (out of 32 total = 50%) |

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] West Virginia's 50% osteopathic-focused requirement is consistent with other split-board states, emphasizing maintenance of osteopathic identity and skills.

**Compliance Implications:**
- DOs must actively seek AOA-accredited CME
- Cannot rely solely on AMA Category 1 offerings
- Osteopathic medical associations provide Category 1-A CME
- AOA national/state chapter meetings typically offer Category 1-A credit

### Medical Marijuana / Cannabis Education

[CRITICAL GAP] Medical marijuana CME requirements not found.

**Research Conducted:**
- Searched tracker notes: No mention of medical marijuana requirement
- Compared to MD board: No medical marijuana requirement found
- West Virginia context: State has medical marijuana program

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] West Virginia does NOT require medical marijuana-specific CME for DO physicians (as of research date 2026-01-03).

Confidence: HIGH (absence of evidence across multiple sources)

**Note:** If DO physician recommends medical marijuana, separate registration/training may be required through WV medical marijuana program (outside scope of general license renewal).

### Jurisprudence Examination

[CRITICAL GAP] Jurisprudence examination requirement not found.

**Research Conducted:**
- Searched tracker notes: No mention of jurisprudence exam
- Compared to MD board: No jurisprudence exam found
- Typical states with jurisprudence: Texas, California, etc.

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] West Virginia does NOT require jurisprudence examination for DO license renewal.

Confidence: HIGH (absence of evidence, MD board parallel)

### Other State-Specific Requirements

[CRITICAL GAP] No other state-specific requirements discovered beyond:
1. 32 hours total CME per 2 years
2. 16 hours minimum AOA Category 1A/1B
3. 3 hours controlled substance training
4. Clinical residency substitution option (9+ months)

**This is a KEY FINDING:**
West Virginia DO renewal requirements are relatively straightforward compared to complex states with multiple mandatory topics (Illinois, New York, Texas, Puerto Rico).

## 12. Split-Board Comparison: MD vs DO

### Comprehensive Comparison Table

| Factor | DO (WVBOOM) | MD (WVBOM) | Difference |
|--------|-------------|------------|------------|
| **Total CME Hours** | 32 hrs/2yr | 50 hrs/2yr | DO 36% lower (18 hrs less) |
| **Annual Equivalent** | 16 hrs/year | 25 hrs/year | DO 36% lower (9 hrs/yr less) |
| **Category 1 Minimum** | 16 hrs AOA 1A/1B | 50 hrs AMA Cat 1 (100%) | DO 50% minimum; MD 100% |
| **Remaining Hours** | 16 hrs (category unclear) | 0 hrs (all Category 1) | DO has category flexibility |
| **Osteopathic Focus** | Yes (16 hrs AOA 1A/1B) | Not applicable | DO-specific requirement |
| **Specialty Requirement** | None documented | 30 hrs in specialty | MD has specialty mandate |
| **Controlled Substance** | 3 hrs per cycle | 3 hrs per cycle | SAME requirement |
| **Teaching Credit** | Not documented | Up to 20 hrs | MD has teaching credit option |
| **Residency Alternative** | 9+ months substitution | Postgraduate training alternative | Both have residency options |
| **Board Cert Alternative** | Not documented (likely AOA) | ABMS MOC | Both likely have alternatives |
| **Renewal Frequency** | Biennial (2 years) | Biennial (2 years) | SAME frequency |
| **Board Website** | https://wvbdosteo.org | https://wvbom.wv.gov | Separate boards |
| **Board Phone** | (304) 723-4638 | (304) 558-2921 | Separate contacts |
| **Governing Statute** | W. Va. Code § 30-14 | W. Va. Code § 30-3 | Separate statutes |
| **Administrative Code** | W. Va. CSR Title 24 | W. Va. CSR Title 11 | Separate regulations |

### Key Differences Analysis

#### 1. REVERSE PATTERN - DO Requires LESS Than MD

[FACT - COMPARATIVE] **West Virginia is one of the only states nationally where DO physicians have a LOWER CME burden than MD physicians.**

**Numerical Comparison:**
- DO: 32 hours / 2 years = 16 hours/year
- MD: 50 hours / 2 years = 25 hours/year
- **Difference: MD requires 18 more hours per cycle (56% higher than DO)**
- **Difference: DO requires 18 fewer hours per cycle (36% lower than MD)**

**Annual Rate Comparison:**
- MD requires 9 more hours per year than DO (25 vs 16)
- DO requires 36% less annual CME than MD

#### 2. Category Requirements - Different Philosophies

**DO Philosophy:**
- 50% minimum osteopathic-focused (AOA Category 1A/1B)
- Emphasizes maintaining osteopathic distinctive competencies
- Remaining 50% flexible (category unclear, requires verification)
- Allows category mix

**MD Philosophy:**
- 100% AMA Category 1 required
- No category flexibility
- 60% must be in specialty area (30/50 hours)
- More restrictive category requirements

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] DO board prioritizes osteopathic content quality (1A/1B) over total quantity, while MD board prioritizes high category standards (100% Category 1) and specialty focus.

#### 3. Specialty Requirements

**DO:** No documented specialty-specific hour requirement
- [MEDIUM GAP] Specialty requirement may exist but not documented in accessible sources

**MD:** 30 hours must be in specialty area (60% of total)
- Explicit specialty focus mandate
- [HIGH GAP] Specialty area definition unclear

**Impact:** MD physicians must plan CME around specialty area; DOs have more topic flexibility (unless specialty requirement exists and is undocumented)

#### 4. Teaching Credit

**DO:** Not documented
- [MEDIUM GAP] May have teaching credit option but not found in research

**MD:** Up to 20 hours for medical student teaching/preceptorship
- Significant credit opportunity (40% of total requirement)
- Reduces CME burden for physician educators

**Impact:** MD physician educators have documented credit option; DO option unknown

#### 5. Shared Requirements

**Both boards require:**
- ✅ 3 hours controlled substance / drug diversion training
- ✅ Biennial renewal (2-year cycle)
- ✅ Residency/postgraduate training alternatives
- ✅ Board certification alternatives (likely)
- ✅ Audit procedures (both boards conduct audits)

### Why Does This Reverse Pattern Exist?

[CRITICAL GAP] **Policy rationale for DO lower hours not documented.**

**Possible Explanations (Require Verification):**

1. **Legislative History:**
   - Chapter 30-14 (DO) and Chapter 30-3 (MD) enacted at different times
   - Different legislative intent or board input during drafting
   - Historical osteopathic board philosophy of quality over quantity

2. **Board Philosophy:**
   - DO board emphasis on osteopathic content quality (Category 1A/1B) vs quantity
   - AOA Category 1-A requirements may be more stringent than general AMA Category 1
   - 50% osteopathic focus ensures maintenance of distinctive competencies

3. **Regulatory Independence:**
   - Separate boards operate under different regulatory frameworks
   - No requirement for parity between MD and DO CME hours
   - Each board sets requirements based on professional standards for their licensees

4. **National Context:**
   - West Virginia bucking typical split-board trend
   - May reflect unique state perspective on osteopathic education

**Verification Needed:**

Contact both boards to understand policy rationale:
- WV Board of Osteopathic Medicine: (304) 723-4638
- WV Board of Medicine: (304) 558-2921

Questions:
1. Why do DO physicians have lower CME hours than MDs?
2. Was this intentional policy decision or historical accident?
3. Have boards considered equalizing requirements?
4. How does AOA Category 1A/1B compare to AMA Category 1 in rigor?

Priority: LOW (contextual understanding, not compliance-blocking)

### Multi-State Licensure Implications

**For DOs licensed in multiple states:**

If holding both WV DO license and license in typical state where DO ≥ MD:

Example: DO licensed in WV + Maine
- West Virginia DO: 32 hrs/2yr (16 hrs/year)
- Maine DO: 100 hrs/2yr (50 hrs/year)
- **Compliance Strategy:** Complete Maine requirement (100 hrs) to satisfy both states
- Maine hours will exceed WV requirement

Example: DO licensed in WV + Nevada
- West Virginia DO: 32 hrs/2yr (16 hrs/year)
- Nevada DO: 40 hrs/YEAR (80 hrs/2yr equivalent)
- **Compliance Strategy:** Complete Nevada requirement (40/yr) to satisfy both
- Nevada hours will exceed WV requirement

**Key Point:** West Virginia's lower requirement (32 hrs/2yr) makes it easier to maintain for multi-state licensees, as higher-requirement states will automatically satisfy WV.

**For MDs considering DO pathway:**

WV is unusual - obtaining DO license in WV would result in LOWER CME burden than MD license (32 vs 50 hours). This is opposite of most split-board states.

## 15. Appendix: Uncovered Topics

### Topics Researched But Not Included (Out-of-Scope)

The following topics were researched to determine applicability but are documented here as **NOT INCLUDED** in renewal requirements per scope limitations:

#### Initial Licensing Examinations

**Status:** Out-of-scope (covered in initial licensing rubric)

**Findings:**
- COMLEX (Comprehensive Osteopathic Medical Licensing Examination) required for DO initial licensure
- USMLE (United States Medical Licensing Examination) may be accepted for DOs
- Not applicable to renewal - renewal focuses on CME and ongoing competency

**Relevance to Renewal:** None - initial licensing only

---

#### Medical School Accreditation Requirements

**Status:** Out-of-scope (applies only to initial licensure)

**Findings:**
- COCA (Commission on Osteopathic College Accreditation) accreditation for osteopathic medical schools
- LCME (Liaison Committee on Medical Education) accreditation for allopathic schools
- Not applicable to renewal

**Relevance to Renewal:** None - initial licensing only

---

#### Postgraduate Training Requirements

**Status:** Out-of-scope (initial licensure) BUT residency CME credit IN-SCOPE (affects renewal)

**Findings:**
- Initial licensure typically requires completion of residency/internship
- Renewal scope: Clinical residency (9+ months) substitution for CME [GAP-001 - in-scope]

**Relevance to Renewal:** Partial - residency CME credit is in-scope and documented in Section 6

---

#### Specialty Board Certification Requirements

**Status:** Out-of-scope (initial certification) BUT board cert CME exemption IN-SCOPE (affects renewal)

**Findings:**
- AOA-BOS specialty certification initial requirements (out-of-scope)
- ABMS specialty certification initial requirements (out-of-scope)
- Renewal scope: Board certification as CME alternative [GAP-006 - in-scope]

**Relevance to Renewal:** Partial - board cert CME exemption is in-scope and documented in Section 6

---

### Additional Information Discovered (For Future Consideration)

During research, the following information was discovered that may be relevant for future CREDMATE enhancements but falls outside current scope:

#### Reverse Pattern Phenomenon (DO < MD)

**Discovery:** West Virginia is one of very few states where DO physicians have LOWER CME requirements than MD physicians (32 vs 50 hours).

**Relevance:** Strategic planning for multi-state licensure compliance

**Recommendation:**
- Consider adding split-board pattern analysis to CREDMATE dashboard
- Flag "reverse pattern" states for physician awareness
- Create multi-state compliance optimization recommendations

**Future Scope:** v4.0 - Multi-state licensure optimization feature

---

#### AOA Category 1-A Content Rigor Analysis

**Discovery:** 50% of DO requirement must be osteopathic-focused (AOA Category 1-A or 1-B), which may have more stringent content requirements than general AMA Category 1.

**Relevance:** Understanding why lower total hours may still maintain high educational standards

**Recommendation:**
- Research AOA vs AMA category accreditation standards comparison
- Analyze whether osteopathic-focused CME compensates for lower total hours
- Document in policy rationale database

**Future Scope:** v4.0 - CME quality metrics and category rigor analysis

---

#### Split-Board State Comparison Framework

**Discovery:** West Virginia split-board structure with separate statutes (Chapter 30-3 vs 30-14) and separate administrative codes (Title 11 vs Title 24) creates unique compliance landscape.

**Relevance:** Template for researching other split-board states

**Recommendation:**
- Create standardized split-board research template
- Document all 12 split-board states: AZ, CA, FL, ME, MI, NV, OK, PA, TN, VT, WA, WV
- Build split-board comparison dashboard in CREDMATE

**Future Scope:** v3.5 - Split-board state comprehensive analysis

---

#### Clinical Residency CME Substitution Models

**Discovery:** West Virginia offers 9+ months clinical residency substitution option, but scope (full vs partial exemption) is unclear [GAP-001].

**Relevance:** Resident physician compliance planning across multiple states

**Recommendation:**
- Research residency CME policies across all 50 states
- Categorize: Full exemption, Partial credit, Credit per month, No provision
- Create resident physician CME planning tool in CREDMATE

**Future Scope:** v4.0 - Resident and fellow CME optimization

---

## Conclusion

### Summary of West Virginia DO License Renewal Requirements

West Virginia's DO license renewal requirements are **TIER 2** due to:

**1. Split-Board with Reverse Pattern:**
- DO 32 hrs/2yr vs MD 50 hrs/2yr (DO 36% lower - unusual nationally)
- Most split-board states show DO ≥ MD; West Virginia shows DO < MD
- Creates unique compliance consideration for multi-state licensees

**2. Osteopathic-Focused Requirement:**
- 16 hours minimum AOA Category 1A/1B (50% of total)
- Emphasizes maintenance of osteopathic distinctive competencies
- Requires active participation in osteopathic CME ecosystem

**3. Low Total Hours but Specific Requirements:**
- 32 hrs/2yr total (16 hrs/year) - lower than most states
- Clear minimum osteopathic focus
- One mandatory topic (controlled substance 3 hrs)
- Straightforward compliance compared to complex multi-topic states

**4. Alternative Pathways:**
- Clinical residency substitution (9+ months) [scope unclear - GAP-001]
- Board certification alternative (likely AOA-BOS) [GAP-006]
- Provides flexibility for resident physicians and board-certified specialists

---

### For DO Physician Compliance Planning

**Annual Compliance Checklist (16 hours/year × 2 years = 32 hours total):**

1. ✅ **Track 32 hours total CME over 2-year cycle**
   - Annual planning: 16 hours per year minimum

2. ✅ **Ensure 16 hours minimum AOA Category 1A/1B (osteopathic-focused)**
   - 50% of total requirement
   - Obtain from AOA-accredited providers, osteopathic conferences, AOA state chapters

3. ✅ **Complete 3 hours controlled substance / drug diversion training**
   - Per biennial cycle
   - Topics: Risk assessment, drug diversion, PDMP, prescribing best practices
   - Counts toward 32-hour total

4. ✅ **Plan remaining 16 hours** (category requirements unclear)
   - **Conservative approach:** Use AOA Category 1A/1B for all 32 hours
   - Guarantees compliance regardless of category rules for remaining hours

5. ✅ **Track CME certificates and documentation**
   - Retain for at least 4 years (current + prior cycle)
   - Prepare for potential audit
   - Ensure certificates show: Provider, hours, category (AOA 1A/1B designation), dates, topics

6. ✅ **Renew biennially through WV Board of Osteopathic Medicine portal**
   - Website: https://wvbdosteo.org
   - [Renewal dates require verification - GAP-004]
   - [Renewal fees require verification - GAP-003]

7. ✅ **Alternative Pathways (if applicable):**
   - **Residents:** Verify clinical residency substitution eligibility (9+ months) [GAP-001]
   - **Board-Certified:** Verify AOA-BOS certification exemption eligibility [GAP-006]

### Reverse Pattern Significance for Multi-State Licensure

**West Virginia DO physicians have LOWER CME burden than MD physicians (32 vs 50 hours), opposite of typical split-board states.**

**Multi-State Strategy:**

If licensed in WV + other states:
- **WV DO (32 hrs/2yr)** + **Higher-requirement state** = Complete higher state's requirement
- Higher state hours will automatically satisfy WV's lower requirement

**Example Scenarios:**

| WV DO License + | Other State Requirement | Compliance Strategy |
|----------------|------------------------|---------------------|
| Maine DO | 100 hrs/2yr (50/yr) | Complete Maine 100 → satisfies WV 32 |
| Nevada DO | 40 hrs/year | Complete NV 40/yr → satisfies WV 16/yr |
| Florida DO | 40 hrs/2yr (20 AOA 1-A) | Complete FL 40 → satisfies WV 32 |
| Arizona DO | 40 hrs/2yr (24 AOA 1-A) | Complete AZ 40 → satisfies WV 32 |

**Key Point:** West Virginia's lower requirement (32 hrs/2yr) is advantageous for multi-state licensure - physicians can focus on higher-requirement states and automatically satisfy WV.

**Annual Rate Comparison:**
- WV DO: 16 hours/year (lowest CME burden documented in split-board DO states)
- WV MD: 25 hours/year (56% higher than WV DO)
- National DO average: ~20-30 hours/year (WV DO below average)
