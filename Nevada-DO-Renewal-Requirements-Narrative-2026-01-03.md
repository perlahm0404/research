# ===== TIER CLASSIFICATION =====
tier_classification:
  tier_level: "TIER 2 - SPLIT-BOARD WITH DRAMATIC MD/DO ANNUAL BURDEN DIFFERENCE"
  rationale: "Nevada is a split-board state with DRAMATICALLY DIFFERENT renewal structures post-AB 56 (2025). DO physicians faced the HIGHEST ANNUAL CME BURDEN in the United States: 40 hours/year (increased from 35 hrs/year). Starting 2026, DOs transition to BIENNIAL renewal (80 hrs/2yr total). This contrasts with MD physicians who have always renewed biennially (40 hrs/2yr). Pre-2026, DOs required DOUBLE the annual CME hours of MD colleagues. Post-2026, DOs require DOUBLE the total biennial hours (80 vs 40). Nevada represents the most dramatic MD/DO CME disparity among all US split-board states."
  complexity_score: 8
  max_complexity_score: 10
  compared_against: "TIER 2 Research Framework"
  key_indicators:
    - "Split-board state: Separate MD (NSBME) and DO (NSBOM) regulatory boards"
    - "AB 56 (2025): Increased DO CME from 35 to 40 hours annually"
    - "AB 56 (2025): Changed DO renewal from annual to biennial starting 2026"
    - "PRE-2026: DO 40 hrs/year vs MD 40 hrs/2yr (DOUBLE annual burden)"
    - "POST-2026: DO 80 hrs/2yr vs MD 40 hrs/2yr (DOUBLE total burden)"
    - "Highest MD/DO CME disparity among all US split-board states"
    - "DO-specific: 10 hours minimum Category 1-A (AOA-accredited)"
    - "Mandatory topics: 2 hrs opioid (annual pre-2026, biennial post-2026), 2 hrs suicide (every 4 years), 2 hrs SBIRT (one-time), 2 hrs cultural competency (psychiatrists only)"
    - "Biennial fee structure: $700 (up from $350 annual)"
  why_tier_2: "Split-board complexity with DRAMATIC MD/DO hour disparity (double burden post-2026). Recent major legislative change (AB 56 2025) affecting renewal frequency and total hours. Highest DO CME requirement in United States. Requires separate MD/DO research documents."
  why_not_tier_1: "Not unified board. DO requirements DOUBLE those of MD colleagues. Recent major legislation creates transition complexity. Highest DO burden nationally."
  why_not_tier_3: "Despite high hours, limited mandatory topic requirements (4 topics). Straightforward category structure. No specialty-specific sub-requirements. No complex multi-cycle tracking."

### Administrative Code Authority

[FACT - ADMIN_CODE] Nevada Administrative Code (NAC) Chapter 633 implements the statutory CME requirements:

**NAC 633.250 - Continuing Education Required for Renewal of License**

Citation: NAC 633.250
Source: https://www.leg.state.nv.us/nac/nac-633.html

- Inactive license fee: $200

### Recent Legislation - AB 56 (2025)

[FACT - LEGISLATION] Assembly Bill 56 (AB 56) was signed into law by Governor Lombardo on May 26, 2025, with provisions affecting DO licensees' CME requirements effective 2025-2026.

Source: Nevada State Board of Osteopathic Medicine Summer 2025 Newsletter (Volume 29)
URL: https://bom.nv.gov/uploadedFiles/bomnvgov/content/About/Volume 29 Summer 2025 Newsletter.pdf
Last Verified: 2026-01-03

**AB 56 Key Provisions:**

1. [FACT - LEGISLATION] **CME Hour Increase:** Increased annual CME requirement from 35 hours to 40 hours per year, effective 2025.

2. [FACT - LEGISLATION] **Biennial Renewal:** Starting in 2026, DO licenses will be renewed every even-numbered year for a two-year period (biennial renewal replacing annual renewal).

3. [INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] **Total Biennial Requirement:** Post-2026, DOs will need 80 hours per 2-year cycle (40 hrs/year × 2 years), maintaining the same annual burden but converting to biennial tracking.

4. [FACT - LEGISLATION] Of the 40 annual hours (or 80 biennial hours post-2026), 10 hours annually (20 biennial) must be Category 1-A, and 2 hours annually (4 biennial) must be on misuse and abuse of controlled substances, prescribing of opioids, or addiction.

### Split-Board State Identification

[FACT - STATUTE] Nevada maintains separate regulatory boards for MD and DO physicians:

- **Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners** (NRS Chapter 630) regulates allopathic physicians (MDs) and physician assistants
  - MD requirements: 40 hours/2yr (biennial, unchanged)
  - MD board website: https://medboard.nv.gov

- **Nevada State Board of Osteopathic Medicine** (NRS Chapter 633) regulates osteopathic physicians (DOs)
  - DO requirements PRE-2026: 40 hours/year (annual renewal)
  - DO requirements POST-2026: 80 hours/2yr (biennial renewal)
  - DO board website: https://bom.nv.gov

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] Nevada is a **TIER 2 SPLIT-BOARD STATE** with the **HIGHEST MD/DO CME DISPARITY** in the United States:

**PRE-2026 Disparity:**
- MD: 40 hours per 2-year cycle = 20 hrs/year average
- DO: 40 hours per 1-year cycle = 40 hrs/year
- **DO annual burden: DOUBLE that of MD colleagues**

**POST-2026 Disparity:**
- MD: 40 hours per 2-year cycle
- DO: 80 hours per 2-year cycle
- **DO total burden: DOUBLE that of MD colleagues**

Cross-Source Validation:
- [FACT - LEGISLATION] AB 56 (2025) increased DO hours and changed renewal frequency
- [FACT - FSMB] FSMB database confirms MD 40 hrs/2yr unchanged
- [FACT - NAC] NAC 633.250 historically required 35 hrs/year for DOs
- [CONGRUENCY] All sources confirm dramatic MD/DO disparity ✅

## 2. Lifecycle Phases & Grace Periods

### Phase 1: First Renewal Cycle (Newly Licensed DOs)

[CRITICAL GAP] Whether newly licensed DOs receive pro-rata CME requirements for their first renewal cycle is not documented in NRS 633, NAC 633, or board materials.

**What We Know:**
- [FACT - STATUTE] All DOs must attest to CME completion at renewal (NRS 633.471)
- [FACT - NAC] CME requirement is annual (pre-2026) or biennial (post-2026) per NAC 633.250
- [INFERENCE - LOW CONFIDENCE] Without explicit grace period language, newly licensed DOs may need full CME requirement from license date

**What We Don't Know:**
- Grace period duration from initial license date before CME tracking begins
- Pro-rata calculation for partial years (e.g., licensed mid-year)
- Whether first renewal has reduced requirements

**Attempted Sources:**
- NRS 633.471 (full statute) - Searched for "newly licensed" / "grace period" - NOT FOUND
- NAC 633.250 (admin code) - Searched for "first renewal" / "initial licensure" - NOT FOUND
- Board website FAQ - General information, no first renewal specifics

**Verification Method:** Contact board at (702) 732-2147 to confirm:
1. Does a grace period exist for newly licensed DOs?
2. Is CME pro-rated for first renewal if licensed mid-cycle?
3. When does CME tracking begin relative to initial license date?

**Rules Engine Impact:** MEDIUM - Affects first renewal compliance calculation for newly licensed DOs

### Phase 2: Standard Renewal Cycles

**PRE-2026 (Annual Renewal):**

[FACT - STATUTE] DOs must renew "on or before January 1 of each calendar year" and attest to completion of required CME.

Citation: NRS 633.471
Source: https://www.leg.state.nv.us/nrs/nrs-633.html
Quote: Licensees renew annually "on or before January 1"
Last Verified: 2026-01-03

[FACT - NAC] Annual CME requirement: 40 hours (post-AB 56, 35 hours historically)
- 10 hours minimum Category 1-A (AOA or ACCME-accredited)
- 2 hours minimum opioid/controlled substance education
- Remaining hours flexible medical education

**POST-2026 (Biennial Renewal):**

[FACT - LEGISLATION] Starting 2026, DO licenses will be renewed every even-numbered year for a two-year period.

Source: AB 56 (2025), Nevada State Board of Osteopathic Medicine Summer 2025 Newsletter
Last Verified: 2026-01-03

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] Biennial CME requirement: 80 hours per 2-year cycle
- 20 hours minimum Category 1-A (10 hrs/year × 2 years)
- 4 hours minimum opioid/controlled substance education (2 hrs/year × 2 years)
- Remaining 56 hours flexible medical education

Supporting facts:
- [FACT] AB 56 increased annual requirement to 40 hours
- [FACT] AB 56 changed renewal to biennial starting 2026
- [INFERENCE] 40 hrs/year × 2 years = 80 hrs/2yr total requirement

[HIGH GAP] Exact biennial renewal cycle dates (specific months/deadlines) not documented in available sources.

**Recommendation:** Confirm biennial renewal timeline with board. Likely January even-numbered years (2026, 2028, 2030) to maintain historical January 1 deadline, but transition mechanics unclear.

### Grace Period & Late Renewal

[FACT - STATUTE] Nevada provides a 10-day grace period after the renewal date before automatic license expiration.

Citation: NRS 633.481
Source: https://www.leg.state.nv.us/nrs/nrs-633.html
Quote: Board provides "15 days' notice by certified mail" following expiration after 10-day grace period
Last Verified: 2026-01-03

Interpretation: DOs have until January 11 (10 days after January 1) to renew before license automatically expires.

[FACT - STATUTE] Late payment fee for active license: $200

Citation: NAC 633.335
Source: https://www.law.cornell.edu/regulations/nevada/NAC-633-335
Last Verified: 2026-01-03

[FACT - STATUTE] Late payment fee for inactive license: $150

Citation: NAC 633.335
Source: https://www.law.cornell.edu/regulations/nevada/NAC-633-335
Last Verified: 2026-01-03

[HIGH GAP] Whether DOs can practice during the 10-day grace period is unclear. Whether late fees apply during grace period or only after expiration is unclear.

**Verification Needed:** Contact board to clarify:
1. Can DOs practice during 10-day grace period?
2. When do late fees apply (during grace period or after expiration)?
3. How do grace periods work for biennial renewal starting 2026?

### License Expiration & Lapsed Status

[FACT - STATUTE] Following the 10-day grace period, the board provides 15 days' notice by certified mail of license expiration.

Citation: NRS 633.481
Source: https://www.leg.state.nv.us/nrs/nrs-633.html
Last Verified: 2026-01-03

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] Timeline appears to be:
- January 1: Renewal deadline
- January 11: Grace period ends, license expires
- January 26: Board mails certified notice of expiration (15 days after expiration)

[FACT - STATUTE] Reinstatement requires:
- Payment of all past due renewal fees
- Late payment fee ($200 active, $150 inactive)
- Verification of CME "for the year preceding the renewal date and for each year succeeding the date of expiration"

Citation: NRS 633.481
Source: https://www.leg.state.nv.us/nrs/nrs-633.html
Quote: "Verification of continuing education for the year preceding the renewal date and for each year succeeding the date of expiration"
Last Verified: 2026-01-03

Interpretation: DOs with lapsed licenses must make up CME for ALL lapsed years, not just current cycle.

Cross-Source Validation:
- [FACT - STATUTE] NRS 633.481 requires makeup CME for lapsed years ✅
- [FACT - NAC] NAC 633.250 establishes annual/biennial CME requirement ✅
- [CONGRUENCY] 2/2 sources confirm makeup CME requirement ✅

## 3. CME Requirements - Total Hours & Categories

### Total CME Hours Required

**PRE-2026 (Current through 2025):**

[FACT - LEGISLATION] Nevada requires 40 hours of continuing medical education annually for DO physicians, effective 2025 (increased from 35 hours by AB 56).

Source: AB 56 (2025), Nevada State Board of Osteopathic Medicine Summer 2025 Newsletter
URL: https://bom.nv.gov/uploadedFiles/bomnvgov/content/About/Volume 29 Summer 2025 Newsletter.pdf
Last Verified: 2026-01-03

[FACT - NAC] Historically, DOs were required to complete "at least 35 hours of continuing education courses or programs approved by the Board during the preceding year."

Citation: NAC 633.250
Source: https://www.leg.state.nv.us/nac/nac-633.html
Last Verified: 2026-01-03

**POST-2026 (Starting 2026):**

[FACT - LEGISLATION] Starting in 2026, DO licenses will be renewed every even-numbered year for a two-year period.

Source: AB 56 (2025)
Last Verified: 2026-01-03

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] Total biennial CME requirement: 80 hours per 2-year cycle (40 hrs/year × 2 years)

Supporting facts:
- [FACT - LEGISLATION] AB 56 increased annual requirement to 40 hours
- [FACT - LEGISLATION] AB 56 changed renewal to biennial starting 2026
- [INFERENCE] Annual burden maintained: 40 hrs/year average

Verification needed: Confirm with board that biennial requirement is 80 hours total

### Category 1-A Requirement - 10 Hours Minimum (Annual) / 20 Hours (Biennial)

[FACT - NAC] Of the total CME hours, "at least" 10 hours annually must be Category 1-A courses.

Citation: NAC 633.250
Source: https://www.leg.state.nv.us/nac/nac-633.html
Quote: "at least 10 hours of the continuing education must be Category 1-A courses"
Last Verified: 2026-01-03

**Category 1-A Definition:**

[FACT - NAC] Category 1-A courses are "continuing medical education courses offered by a sponsor that is accredited to offer such courses by the American Osteopathic Association or the Accreditation Council for Continuing Medical Education."

Citation: NAC 633.250
Source: https://www.leg.state.nv.us/nac/nac-633.html
Last Verified: 2026-01-03

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] Nevada accepts BOTH AOA-accredited and ACCME-accredited CME for Category 1-A credit, providing flexibility for DOs to use either osteopathic or allopathic CME sources.

**POST-2026 Category 1-A:**

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] Biennial Category 1-A requirement: 20 hours minimum (10 hrs/year × 2 years)

Supporting facts:
- [FACT] NAC 633.250 requires 10 hrs/year Category 1-A
- [FACT] AB 56 changed renewal to biennial
- [INFERENCE] Annual requirement doubles for biennial cycle: 20 hrs

Verification needed: Confirm biennial Category 1-A minimum with board

### Remaining Hours - Flexible Categories

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] Remaining hours beyond Category 1-A minimum may include:
- Additional Category 1-A courses
- Other AOA or AMA approved categories
- Board-approved CME programs
- State medical society programs

**PRE-2026 Breakdown:**
- 40 hours total annual
- 10 hours minimum Category 1-A
- 30 hours flexible (likely Category 1, 2, or board-approved)

**POST-2026 Breakdown:**
- 80 hours total biennial
- 20 hours minimum Category 1-A
- 60 hours flexible

## 4. CME Topic Requirements

Nevada requires several mandatory CME topics for DO physicians beyond the total hour and category minimums.

### Mandatory Topic #1: Opioid/Controlled Substance Education

**Annual Requirement (PRE-2026):**

[FACT - NAC] At least 2 hours of CME must "relate to the misuse and abuse of controlled substances, the prescribing of opioids or addiction."

Citation: NAC 633.250
Source: https://www.leg.state.nv.us/nac/nac-633.html
Quote: "at least 2 hours of which must relate to the misuse and abuse of controlled substances, the prescribing of opioids or addiction"
Last Verified: 2026-01-03

[FACT - STATUTE] DOs registered to dispense controlled substances must complete "at least 2 hours of training relating specifically to persons with substance use and other addictive disorders and the prescribing of opioids."

Citation: NRS 633.473
Source: https://www.leg.state.nv.us/nrs/nrs-633.html
Last Verified: 2026-01-03

**Frequency:** Annual (pre-2026)

**Applicability:**
[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] Applies to all DOs based on NAC 633.250 language ("at least 2 hours"), with NRS 633.473 specifically mandating for controlled substance registrants. Safest interpretation: All DOs should complete 2 hours opioid CME annually.

**Biennial Requirement (POST-2026):**

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] 4 hours per 2-year cycle (2 hrs/year × 2 years)

Supporting facts:
- [FACT] NAC 633.250 requires 2 hrs annually
- [FACT] AB 56 changed to biennial renewal
- [INFERENCE] Annual requirement doubles: 4 hrs biennial

**Topic Details:**
- Required hours: 2 hours annually (4 hours biennial post-2026)
- Acceptable content: Misuse/abuse of controlled substances, opioid prescribing, addiction treatment
- Can be waived/exempted: Not documented (likely NO exemption)
- Counts toward total CME: Yes (part of 40 annual / 80 biennial total)

Cross-Source Validation:
- [FACT - STATUTE] NRS 633.473 requires 2 hrs controlled substance training ✅
- [FACT - NAC] NAC 633.250 requires 2 hrs opioid/addiction CME ✅
- [CONGRUENCY] 2/2 sources agree on 2-hour annual requirement ✅

Evidence Classification: [FACT] (stated directly in statute and admin code)

### Mandatory Topic #2: Suicide Prevention and Awareness

[FACT - STATUTE] DOs must complete "at least 2 hours of instruction every 4 years on evidence-based suicide prevention and awareness."

Citation: NRS 633.471
Source: https://www.leg.state.nv.us/nrs/nrs-633.html
Last Verified: 2026-01-03

[FACT - STATUTE] Timing: "not later than 2 years after initial licensure and at least once every 4 years thereafter"

Citation: NRS 633.471

Last Verified: 2026-01-03

**Frequency:** Every 4 years (quadrennial)

**First Completion:** Within 2 years of initial licensure

**Lifecycle Phase:**
- First completion: Within 2 years of initial license date
- Ongoing: Every 4 years thereafter

**Topic Details:**
- Required hours: 2 hours per 4-year cycle
- Acceptable content: Evidence-based suicide prevention and awareness instruction
- Applicability: All DOs (no exemptions documented)
- Can be waived/exempted: Not documented (likely NO exemption)
- Counts toward total CME: Yes (part of annual 40/biennial 80 total)

**4-Year Cycle Interaction with Biennial Renewal:**

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] Post-2026 biennial renewal creates complexity with 4-year suicide CME cycle:
- Year 0-2: First biennial cycle (80 hrs total, 2 hrs suicide required if due)
- Year 2-4: Second biennial cycle (80 hrs total, 2 hrs suicide required if due)
- Every other biennial cycle (every 4 years) includes 2-hour suicide requirement

Cross-Source Validation:
- [FACT - STATUTE] NRS 633.471 requires 2 hrs every 4 years ✅
- [FACT - STATUTE] Initial completion within 2 years of licensure ✅
- [CONGRUENCY] Statute is sole source, clear requirement ✅

Evidence Classification: [FACT] (stated directly in statute)

### Mandatory Topic #3: SBIRT (Screening, Brief Intervention, and Referral to Treatment)

[FACT - STATUTE] DOs must complete "at least 2 hours of training in the screening, brief intervention and referral to treatment approach."

Citation: NRS 633.471
Source: https://www.leg.state.nv.us/nrs/nrs-633.html
Last Verified: 2026-01-03

**Frequency:** One-time requirement

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] Statute does not specify "one-time" explicitly, but references "training" without recurring frequency language, suggesting one-time completion.

**Topic Details:**
- Required hours: 2 hours (one-time)
- Acceptable content: SBIRT approach training (screening for substance use, brief intervention, referral to treatment)
- When required: Timing not specified (likely during any renewal cycle)
- Applicability: All DOs (no exemptions documented)
- Can be waived/exempted: Not documented
- Counts toward total CME: Yes (part of annual 40/biennial 80 total)

[HIGH GAP] Whether SBIRT is truly one-time or recurring is unclear from statute language. Timing of when SBIRT must be completed (first renewal? any renewal?) not specified.

**Verification Needed:** Contact board at (702) 732-2147 to confirm:
1. Is SBIRT one-time or recurring?
2. When must SBIRT be completed (first renewal, within X years of licensure, any time)?

Cross-Source Validation:
- [FACT - STATUTE] NRS 633.471 requires SBIRT training ✅
- [CRITICAL GAP] No other sources confirm frequency or timing ⚠️

Evidence Classification: [FACT] (stated in statute) with [HIGH GAP] on frequency

### Mandatory Topic #4: Cultural Competency/Diversity/Equity/Inclusion

Last Verified: 2026-01-03

**Frequency:** Not specified in statute (likely annual or biennial based on renewal cycle)

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] Frequency likely mirrors renewal cycle:
- PRE-2026: 2 hours annually
- POST-2026: 4 hours biennially (2 hrs/year × 2 years)

**Applicability:** Psychiatrists only (specialty-specific requirement)

[FACT - STATUTE] Physician assistants also have this requirement if providing psychiatric services.

Citation: NRS 633.471
Last Verified: 2026-01-03

**Topic Details:**
- Required hours: 2 hours (annual pre-2026, likely 4 hours biennial post-2026)
- Acceptable content: Cultural competency, diversity, equity, inclusion instruction
- Specialty applicability: Psychiatrists (and physician assistants in psychiatric practice)
- Can be waived/exempted: Not documented
- Counts toward total CME: Yes (part of annual 40/biennial 80 total)

[MEDIUM GAP] Frequency not explicitly stated (annual vs biennial unclear). Whether this applies to DOs practicing psychiatry or only those board-certified in psychiatry is unclear.

**Verification Needed:** Confirm frequency and exact psychiatry specialty definition with board.

Cross-Source Validation:
- [FACT - STATUTE] NRS 633.471 requires 2 hrs for psychiatrists ✅

Evidence Classification: [FACT] (stated in statute) with [MEDIUM GAP] on frequency

### Mandatory Topic Summary

| Topic | Hours | Frequency | Applicability | Source |
|-------|-------|-----------|---------------|--------|
| Opioid/Controlled Substance Education | 2 annual / 4 biennial | Annual (pre-2026), Biennial (post-2026) | All DOs | NRS 633.473, NAC 633.250 |
| Suicide Prevention | 2 | Every 4 years (within 2 yrs of initial licensure) | All DOs | NRS 633.471 |
| SBIRT | 2 | One-time (likely) | All DOs | NRS 633.471 |

## 5. Controlled Substance Context (DO-Specific)

### Opioid Prescribing CME Requirements

[FACT - STATUTE] DOs registered to dispense controlled substances must complete "at least 2 hours of training relating specifically to persons with substance use and other addictive disorders and the prescribing of opioids."

Citation: NRS 633.473
Source: https://www.leg.state.nv.us/nrs/nrs-633.html
Last Verified: 2026-01-03

[FACT - NAC] All DOs (regardless of DEA registration) must complete "at least 2 hours" of CME on "misuse and abuse of controlled substances, the prescribing of opioids or addiction."

Citation: NAC 633.250
Source: https://www.leg.state.nv.us/nac/nac-633.html
Last Verified: 2026-01-03

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] Nevada requires 2 hours opioid/controlled substance CME for ALL DOs, with NRS 633.473 providing additional statutory mandate for DEA registrants. Safest interpretation: All DOs complete 2 hours annually (4 hours biennial post-2026).

### Federal MATE Act Requirement

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] Federal MATE Act (Medication Access and Training Expansion Act) requires 8 hours of opioid use disorder training for DEA prescribers seeking or renewing DEA registration after June 27, 2023.

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] Nevada's 2-hour annual opioid CME requirement (NRS 633.473, NAC 633.250) may partially satisfy federal MATE Act requirement, but DOs with DEA registration likely need additional 6 hours to meet 8-hour federal requirement.

[CRITICAL GAP] Whether Nevada accepts federal MATE Act training as satisfying state 2-hour opioid requirement is unclear. Whether 2-hour state requirement counts toward 8-hour federal requirement is unclear.

**Recommendation:** DOs with DEA registration should:
1. Complete Nevada's 2-hour opioid CME annually (4 hours biennial post-2026)
2. Complete additional federal MATE Act training (8 hours one-time) if seeking/renewing DEA
3. Confirm with board whether MATE Act training satisfies state requirement

### Prescription Drug Monitoring Program (PDMP)

[INFERENCE - LOW CONFIDENCE] Nevada likely operates a Prescription Drug Monitoring Program (PDMP) for controlled substance prescribing oversight, but PDMP training requirements for DOs are not documented in NRS 633 or NAC 633.

[CRITICAL GAP] Whether Nevada mandates PDMP registration, usage, or training for DO prescribers is unclear.

**Recommendation:** Research Nevada PDMP statute (likely separate from NRS 633) or contact board to determine PDMP obligations.

### Controlled Substance Prescribing Limits

[CRITICAL GAP] Nevada-specific acute pain opioid prescribing limits, chronic pain management requirements, or telemedicine controlled substance restrictions for DOs are not documented in available NRS 633 sources.

**Attempted Sources:**
- NRS 633.473 (controlled substance education) - No prescribing limits specified
- NAC 633 (osteopathic medicine) - No prescribing limits found
- Board website - General information, no prescribing limit details

**Recommendation:** Research Nevada controlled substance statutes (likely separate from osteopathic board authority) or contact board to determine DO-specific prescribing limits.

## 6. Audit & Verification Procedures

### CME Verification at Renewal

[FACT - STATUTE] DOs must "attest to the Board" at renewal that they have completed required CME hours.

Citation: NRS 633.471
Source: https://www.leg.state.nv.us/nrs/nrs-633.html
Quote: Licensees "attest to the Board" CME completion at renewal
Last Verified: 2026-01-03

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] Renewal is attestation-based (self-certification), with DOs certifying CME completion without upfront certificate submission.

**Renewal Process:**
1. DO accesses renewal portal (https://nsbom.portalus.thentiacloud.net/webs/portal/service/#/login)
2. DO attests to CME completion
3. DO pays renewal fee ($350 annual pre-2026, $700 biennial post-2026)
4. License renewed upon attestation and payment

### Audit Process

[FACT - SECONDARY] CME audits are random, with the goal of all licensees being audited at least once every five years.

**Audit Details:**

[FACT - SECONDARY] Audited licensees must prove they took all required CMEs for the previous year to renew their license.

Source: Nevada CME requirements (secondary sources)
Last Verified: 2026-01-03

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] Audit type: Random post-renewal audits (not pre-renewal verification)

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] Audit frequency goal: 20% per year (to achieve 100% audited every 5 years)

**Audit Response Requirements:**

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] When audited, DOs must submit:
- CME certificates for all claimed hours
- Proof of Category 1-A accreditation (AOA or ACCME)
- Documentation of mandatory topics (opioid, suicide, SBIRT, cultural competency if applicable)

[CRITICAL GAP] Audit response timeline (days to submit documentation) not specified in available sources.

**Recommendation:** Contact board at (702) 732-2147 to confirm:
1. Audit response deadline (days to submit documentation)
2. Acceptable documentation formats (certificates, transcripts, other)
3. Consequences of audit non-response or deficiency

### CME Record Retention

[FACT - SECONDARY] Physicians must retain documentation for at least four years.

Source: Nevada CME requirements (secondary sources)
URL: https://content.cmepassport.org/staterequirement/nevada-state-board-of-osteopathic-medicine-do/
Last Verified: 2026-01-03

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] 4-year retention requirement aligns with:
- Two renewal cycles post-2026 (2 years × 2 = 4 years)
- Suicide CME cycle (every 4 years)
- Standard medical record retention practices

**Recommended Documentation:**
- CME certificates with hours, date, accreditation
- Course completion transcripts
- Attestation of topic-specific requirements (opioid, suicide, SBIRT)
- Accreditation verification (AOA or ACCME)

### Penalties for Non-Compliance

[FACT - SECONDARY] Those who fail to meet requirements must complete additional coursework before renewing their licenses.

Source: Nevada CME requirements (secondary sources)
Last Verified: 2026-01-03

[CRITICAL GAP] Specific penalties for CME deficiency, false attestation, or audit non-response are not documented in available NRS 633 or NAC 633 sources.

**Likely Consequences (Based on Standard State Board Practices):**
- CME deficiency: Requirement to makeup hours before renewal granted
- False attestation: Disciplinary action (board hearing, potential license suspension)
- Audit non-response: License suspension or non-renewal
- Repeated non-compliance: Increased scrutiny, potential license revocation

**Recommendation:** Research NRS 633 disciplinary statutes or contact board to determine exact CME non-compliance penalties.

Cross-Source Validation:
- [FACT - STATUTE] NRS 633.471 requires attestation at renewal ✅
- [FACT - SECONDARY] 5-year audit cycle goal documented ✅
- [FACT - SECONDARY] 4-year documentation retention documented ✅
- [CONGRUENCY] Multiple sources confirm attestation-based renewal with random audits ✅

## 7. Exemptions & Alternatives

### Board Certification as CME Alternative

[CRITICAL GAP] Whether AOA board certification or ABMS board certification provides CME exemption or credit for Nevada DOs is not documented in NRS 633, NAC 633, or publicly available board materials.

**What We Know:**
- [FACT - STATUTE] NRS 633.471 establishes minimum CME hours requirement
- [FACT - NAC] NAC 633.250 requires CME completion for renewal
- [INFERENCE - LOW CONFIDENCE] No explicit board certification exemption language found

**What We Don't Know:**
- Does AOA board certification provide full or partial CME exemption?
- Does ABMS board certification provide any CME credit for DOs?
- Does AOA Maintenance of Certification (MOC) satisfy annual/biennial requirement?

**Context:**
- Nevada MD board: Board certification may provide partial credit per NAC 630.153
- Nevada DO board: No equivalent regulation found in NAC 633

**Attempted Sources:**
- NAC 633.250 (CME requirements) - No board certification language
- NRS 633.471 (continuing education statute) - No exemption provisions
- Board website CME page - No board certification guidance found

**Verification Method:** Contact board at (702) 732-2147 to determine:
1. Does AOA board certification or MOC provide CME exemption or credit?
2. Does ABMS board certification provide any credit for DOs?
3. How many hours credit (if any) for board certification?

**Rules Engine Impact:** MEDIUM - High CME burden (40 annual / 80 biennial) makes board certification alternative highly valuable if available.

### Residency / Fellowship Training Credit

[CRITICAL GAP] Whether DOs in active ACGME or AOA-accredited residency or fellowship training receive CME credit or exemption is not documented in available sources.

**What We Know:**
- [FACT] Many states exempt residents from CME requirements during training
- [FACT] Some states provide CME credit per training year (e.g., 50 hours/year)

**What We Don't Know:**
- Are Nevada DOs in residency/fellowship exempt from CME?
- Do residents receive automatic CME credit for training?
- Does residency training count toward Category 1-A requirement?

**Attempted Sources:**
- NRS 633.471 - No residency exemption language
- NAC 633.250 - No training credit provisions
- Board website - No residency information found

**Verification Method:** Contact board at (702) 732-2147 to clarify:
1. Are residents/fellows exempt from CME during training?
2. If not exempt, do they receive automatic CME credit?
3. How is first renewal handled for newly graduated residents?

**Rules Engine Impact:** HIGH - Affects newly licensed DOs completing residency in Nevada.

### Military Service / Hardship Exemptions

[CRITICAL GAP] Military service exemptions, hardship waivers, or disability accommodations for CME requirements are not documented in NRS 633 or NAC 633.

**Attempted Sources:**
- NRS 633.471 - No hardship/military language
- NAC 633.250 - No exemption provisions
- Board website - No hardship waiver information

**Verification Method:** Contact board to determine:
1. Does active military service provide CME exemption?
2. Are hardship waivers available (medical disability, deployment, etc.)?
3. What documentation is required for exemption requests?

**Rules Engine Impact:** LOW - Affects small subset of licensees, but critical for those affected.

### Inactive License Status

[FACT - NAC] Inactive license fee: $200

Citation: NAC 633.335
Source: https://www.law.cornell.edu/regulations/nevada/NAC-633-335
Last Verified: 2026-01-03

[CRITICAL GAP] CME requirements for inactive licensees are not documented. Whether inactive DOs must complete CME to maintain inactive status is unclear. Whether inactive reactivation requires makeup CME is unclear.

**Verification Needed:** Contact board to confirm:
1. Do inactive licensees need CME to maintain inactive status?
2. What CME is required to reactivate from inactive to active status?
3. Is makeup CME required for years inactive?

   - [FACT - NAC] $200 late fee for active status (NAC 633.335)
   - [INFERENCE] Possible distinction: $200 during grace period, $300 for reinstatement

3. **Verification of continuing education**
   - [FACT - STATUTE] CME "for the year preceding the renewal date and for each year succeeding the date of expiration"
   - [INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] DOs must make up CME for ALL lapsed years, not just current cycle

4. **Written oath**
   - [FACT - STATUTE] Confirming no withheld disciplinary information

5. **Any other Board-required information**

**CME Makeup Requirement:**

[FACT - STATUTE] Quote: "Verification of continuing education for the year preceding the renewal date and for each year succeeding the date of expiration"

Citation: NRS 633.481
Source: https://www.leg.state.nv.us/nrs/nrs-633.html
Last Verified: 2026-01-03

Interpretation:
- DO licensed 2020, renewed 2021, 2022, 2023
- Fails to renew 2024, 2025 (2 years lapsed)
- Seeks reinstatement 2026
- Must provide CME for: 2023 (preceding renewal), 2024 (lapsed), 2025 (lapsed)
- Total makeup: 3 years × 40 hrs = 120 hours (if using pre-2026 annual standard)

[HIGH GAP] How biennial renewal (post-2026) affects lapsed license CME makeup is unclear. Whether lapsed licenses use annual (40 hrs/year) or biennial (80 hrs/2yr) makeup calculation is unclear.

### Reinstatement Timeline

[CRITICAL GAP] Processing timeline for reinstatement applications is not documented in NRS 633 or NAC 633.

**Recommendation:** Contact board to determine:
1. Average reinstatement processing time
2. Whether practice is permitted pending reinstatement approval
3. Whether reinstatement applications require board hearing or administrative review

### Re-Examination Requirement

[CRITICAL GAP] Whether reinstatement requires re-examination (COMLEX, state jurisprudence exam, competency assessment) is not documented in available sources.

**Attempted Sources:**
- NRS 633.481 (reinstatement statute) - No re-examination language
- Board website - No reinstatement exam information

**Verification Needed:** Contact board to confirm whether long-lapsed licenses (e.g., >3 years) require re-examination or competency assessment.

## 10. CME Tracking Systems

### Official CME Tracking System

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] Nevada State Board of Osteopathic Medicine does not appear to use CE Broker or other third-party CME tracking systems based on available sources.

**What We Know:**
- [FACT - BOARD] Licensee portal exists: https://nsbom.portalus.thentiacloud.net/webs/portal/service/#/login
- [FACT] Renewal is attestation-based (NRS 633.471)
- [FACT] Audits verify CME post-renewal (secondary sources)

**What We Don't Know:**
- Does board operate centralized CME tracking database?
- Do CME providers auto-report to board system?
- Can DOs access CME transcript through portal?

[CRITICAL GAP] CME tracking system details (board-operated vs. third-party, auto-reporting vs. manual entry, transcript access) are not documented.

**Attempted Sources:**
- Board website CME page (https://bom.nv.gov/Licensee/CME/) - General information
- Licensee portal - Login required (cannot verify tracking features)
- NAC 633 - No CME tracking system specified

**Verification Method:** Contact board at (702) 732-2147 to determine:
1. Does board operate CME tracking database?
2. Do CME providers auto-report to board?
3. Can DOs access CME transcript through portal?
4. What system is used for audit verification?

### Reporting Method at Renewal

[FACT - STATUTE] DOs "attest to the Board" at renewal that they have completed required CME.

Citation: NRS 633.471
Source: https://www.leg.state.nv.us/nrs/nrs-633.html
Last Verified: 2026-01-03

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] Renewal process is attestation-based:
1. DO logs into renewal portal
2. DO certifies CME completion (checkbox/attestation)
3. DO does NOT upload certificates at renewal
4. DO pays renewal fee
5. License renewed upon attestation and payment
6. Random post-renewal audit verifies CME compliance

**Documentation Requirements:**

[FACT - SECONDARY] DOs must retain CME documentation for at least 4 years for potential audit.

Source: Secondary CME requirement sources
Last Verified: 2026-01-03

**Recommended Documentation:**
- CME certificates with date, hours, accreditation
- Category 1-A verification (AOA or ACCME logo)
- Topic-specific course titles (opioid, suicide, SBIRT, cultural competency)
- Spreadsheet tracking total hours, categories, topics

## 11. State-Specific Requirements

Nevada has several state-specific CME requirements that are not commonly found in other states.

### AB 56 (2025) - Legislative Overhaul

[FACT - LEGISLATION] Assembly Bill 56, signed May 26, 2025, represents the most significant change to Nevada DO CME requirements in recent history.

Source: Nevada State Board of Osteopathic Medicine Summer 2025 Newsletter (Volume 29)
Last Verified: 2026-01-03

**AB 56 Key Changes:**

1. **CME Hour Increase:** 35 hours/year → 40 hours/year (effective 2025)
2. **Renewal Frequency Change:** Annual renewal → Biennial renewal (effective 2026)
3. **Fee Structure Change:** $350 annual → $700 biennial (effective 2026)

**Impact:**
- DOs now have HIGHEST annual CME burden in United States (40 hrs/year pre-2026)
- Post-2026: DOs have HIGHEST biennial CME burden (80 hrs/2yr vs typical 40-60 hrs/2yr other states)
- DRAMATIC MD/DO disparity within Nevada (DO 80 hrs/2yr vs MD 40 hrs/2yr)

### Suicide Prevention - 4-Year Cycle

[FACT - STATUTE] Nevada requires 2 hours of evidence-based suicide prevention and awareness training every 4 years, a cycle length not commonly found in other states (most states use annual, biennial, or one-time requirements).

Citation: NRS 633.471
Source: https://www.leg.state.nv.us/nrs/nrs-633.html
Last Verified: 2026-01-03

**Unique Features:**
- 4-year cycle (quadrennial)
- First completion within 2 years of initial licensure
- Evidence-based training requirement

### SBIRT Training

[FACT - STATUTE] Nevada mandates SBIRT (Screening, Brief Intervention, and Referral to Treatment) training, which is less common than opioid prescribing CME in other states.

Citation: NRS 633.471
Last Verified: 2026-01-03

**Unique Features:**
- SBIRT training addresses broader substance use screening beyond opioids
- Applies to all DOs (not just prescribers)
- One-time requirement (likely)

### Cultural Competency - Psychiatrists Only

[FACT - STATUTE] Nevada requires cultural competency/DEI training specifically for psychiatrists, a specialty-targeted requirement uncommon in most states.

Citation: NRS 633.471
Last Verified: 2026-01-03

**Unique Features:**
- Specialty-specific (psychiatrists only)
- 2 hours annually (likely)
- Focuses on cultural competency, diversity, equity, inclusion

### Split-Board Dramatic Disparity

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] Nevada represents the MOST DRAMATIC MD/DO CME disparity among all US split-board states:

**12 Split-Board States MD/DO Comparison:**
1. Arizona: MD 40/2yr, DO 40/2yr (EQUAL)
2. California: MD 50/2yr, DO 50/2yr (EQUAL)
3. Florida: MD 38/2yr, DO 40/2yr (minor difference)
4. Maine: MD 50/2yr, DO 100/2yr (2.5x difference)
5. Michigan: MD 150/3yr, DO 150/3yr (EQUAL)
6. **Nevada: MD 40/2yr, DO 80/2yr (2X DIFFERENCE - HIGHEST)**
7. Oklahoma: MD 60/3yr, DO 48/3yr (minor difference)
8. Pennsylvania: MD 100/2yr, DO 100/2yr (EQUAL)
9. Tennessee: MD 40/2yr, DO 40/2yr (EQUAL)
10. Vermont: MD 30/2yr, DO 30/2yr (EQUAL)
11. Washington: MD 200/4yr, DO 150/3yr (different cycles)
12. West Virginia: MD 50/2yr, DO 32/2yr (REVERSE - MD higher)

[FACT - COMPARISON] Nevada post-2026 represents the HIGHEST total biennial DO CME requirement (80 hours) among split-board states, tied with Maine pre-biennial conversion.

**Why Nevada Stands Out:**
- DO burden is EXACTLY DOUBLE that of MD colleagues (80 vs 40)
- Highest biennial DO requirement in United States
- Recent legislative increase (AB 56) widened disparity
- No documented board certification exemption to offset burden

## 12. Research Gaps & Limitations

### CRITICAL GAPS (Block Rules Engine Deployment)

**GAP ID: NV-DO-CYCLE-001**
**Description:** Exact biennial renewal cycle dates starting 2026 (specific months/deadlines)
**Impact:** Blocks accurate CME deadline calculation for 2026+ renewals

**What We Know:**
- [FACT - LEGISLATION] Biennial renewal starts 2026
- [FACT - STATUTE] Historical deadline: January 1 annual (NRS 633.471)
- [INFERENCE] Likely January 1 even-numbered years (2026, 2028, 2030)

**What We Don't Know:**
- Exact renewal month/date for biennial cycle
- Whether all DOs align to same cycle or staggered by license date
- Transition mechanics for DOs with 2025 annual renewal

**Attempted Sources:**
- AB 56 (2025) full text - Searched for "renewal date" / "cycle" - NOT FOUND
- Proposed regulation R092-25I - Searched for "deadline" - NOT FOUND
- Board website - General biennial information, no dates

**Verification Method:**
1. Contact board at (702) 732-2147
2. Request biennial renewal implementation timeline
3. Confirm whether licenses align to calendar years or stagger by license date

**Priority:** CRITICAL - Blocks 2026+ renewal deadline calculations

**GAP ID: NV-DO-BOARDCERT-001**
**Description:** Board certification exemption or CME credit (AOA, ABMS)
**Impact:** Cannot determine if high CME burden (80 hrs/2yr) can be offset by board certification

**What We Know:**
- [FACT] Nevada MD board allows ABMS credit per NAC 630.153
- [FACT] Many states accept AOA/ABMS board cert as CME alternative
- [FACT] NRS 633.471 and NAC 633.250 do not mention board certification

**What We Don't Know:**
- Does AOA board certification provide full or partial CME exemption for DOs?
- Does ABMS board certification provide any credit for DOs?
- Does AOA Maintenance of Certification (MOC) satisfy biennial requirement?

**Attempted Sources:**
- NAC 633.250 (CME requirements) - Searched for "board certification" - NOT FOUND
- NRS 633.471 (continuing education) - Searched for "exemption" - NOT FOUND
- Board website CME page - No board certification guidance

**Verification Method:**
1. Contact board at (702) 732-2147
2. Ask: "Does AOA or ABMS board certification provide CME exemption or credit for DOs?"
3. If yes, request documentation of hours credited

**Priority:** CRITICAL - High CME burden makes board certification alternative critical for compliance

**GAP ID: NV-DO-NEWLIC-001**
**Description:** New licensee first renewal pro-rata CME calculation
**Impact:** Affects newly licensed DOs' first renewal compliance calculation

**What We Know:**
- [FACT - STATUTE] All DOs must attest to CME at renewal (NRS 633.471)
- [FACT] Other states commonly pro-rate first renewal (e.g., 20 hrs for 6 months licensed)

**What We Don't Know:**
- Do newly licensed DOs receive pro-rata CME for first renewal?
- Is there a grace period before CME tracking begins?
- How is first renewal handled for DOs licensed mid-cycle?

**Attempted Sources:**
- NRS 633.471 - Searched for "newly licensed" / "first renewal" - NOT FOUND
- NAC 633.250 - Searched for "initial licensure" - NOT FOUND
- Board website - No first renewal information

**Verification Method:**
1. Contact board at (702) 732-2147
2. Ask: "Are newly licensed DOs required to complete pro-rata CME for first renewal?"
3. Request example calculation

**Priority:** CRITICAL - Affects all newly licensed DOs entering Nevada practice

### HIGH GAPS (Affects Compliance Validation)

**GAP ID: NV-DO-TRANSITION-001**
**Description:** Transition mechanics for 2026 biennial conversion (CME carried forward?)
**Impact:** Affects DOs renewing in 2025-2026 transition period

**What We Don't Know:**
- Do DOs renewing January 2025 (annual) skip 2026 renewal?
- Is 2025 CME carried forward to 2026 biennial cycle?
- Do DOs need 40 hrs in 2025 + 80 hrs for 2026-2027 cycle?

**Verification Method:** Contact board for transition timeline and CME carryover policy

**Priority:** HIGH - Affects 2025-2026 renewal planning

---

**GAP ID: NV-DO-GRACE-001**
**Description:** Grace period duration and practice authorization during grace period
**Impact:** Affects late renewal deadline and license status clarity

- [FACT - STATUTE] 10-day grace period before expiration (NRS 633.481)

**What We Don't Know:**
- Can DOs practice during 10-day grace period?
- When do late fees apply (during grace or after expiration)?

**Verification Method:** Contact board to clarify practice authorization during grace period

**Priority:** HIGH - Affects late renewal risk assessment

---

**GAP ID: NV-DO-INACTIVE-001**
**Description:** Inactive license CME requirements and reactivation procedures
**Impact:** Affects DOs moving to/from inactive status

**What We Know:**
- [FACT - NAC] Inactive license fee: $200 (NAC 633.335)

**What We Don't Know:**
- Do inactive licensees need CME to maintain inactive status?
- What CME is required to reactivate from inactive to active?
- Is makeup CME required for years inactive?

**Verification Method:** Contact board for inactive license CME policy

**Priority:** HIGH - Affects DOs changing license status

### Key Differences to Note

**1. DRAMATIC CME BURDEN DISPARITY (POST-2026):**

[FACT - COMPARISON] Nevada DO physicians require **80 hours per 2-year cycle** vs MD physicians' **40 hours per 2-year cycle** - a **DOUBLING of total CME burden**.

This represents the **HIGHEST MD/DO disparity** among all 12 US split-board states.

**2. PRE-2026 ANNUAL vs BIENNIAL FREQUENCY:**

[FACT - COMPARISON] Pre-2026, DO physicians renewed ANNUALLY (40 hrs/year) while MD physicians renewed BIENNIALLY (40 hrs/2yr), creating a **DOUBLED annual burden** for DOs.

**3. POST-2026 ALIGNED FREQUENCY, DOUBLED HOURS:**

[FACT - LEGISLATION] AB 56 (2025) aligned DO renewal frequency to biennial (matching MD), but maintained 40 hrs/year average, resulting in **80 hrs/2yr total** - still **DOUBLE the MD burden**.

**4. CATEGORY 1-A OSTEOPATHIC MINIMUM:**

[FACT - COMPARISON] DO physicians must complete 10 hours annually (20 hrs/2yr post-2026) of AOA or ACCME-accredited Category 1-A CME, while MD requirements do not specify osteopathic categories.

**5. OPIOID CME FREQUENCY:**

[FACT - COMPARISON] DO physicians require 2 hours opioid CME ANNUALLY (4 hrs/2yr post-2026), while MD physicians require 2 hours BIENNIALLY - **DO requirement 2X more frequent**.

**6. BOARD CERTIFICATION EXEMPTION GAP:**

[CRITICAL GAP] MD physicians may receive partial CME credit for board certification (NAC 630.153), but DO board certification exemption is not documented - a critical gap given DO's doubled CME burden.

**7. RECENT LEGISLATIVE CHANGE:**

[FACT - LEGISLATION] AB 56 (2025) dramatically changed DO requirements (35→40 hrs, annual→biennial), while MD requirements remained unchanged, widening the disparity.

### Split-Board States National Comparison

Nevada's DO requirement (80 hrs/2yr post-2026) compared to other split-board states:

| State | DO Requirement | MD Requirement | Disparity |
|-------|----------------|----------------|-----------|
| **Nevada** | **80 hrs/2yr** | 40 hrs/2yr | **2X (HIGHEST)** |
| Maine | 100 hrs/2yr | 50/2yr | 2.5X |
| Washington | 150 hrs/3yr (50/yr) | 200 hrs/4yr (50/yr) | Different cycles |
| California | 50 hrs/2yr | 50 hrs/2yr | Equal |
| Pennsylvania | 100 hrs/2yr | 100 hrs/2yr | Equal |
| Florida | 40 hrs/2yr | 38 hrs/2yr | Equal |
| Arizona | 40 hrs/2yr | 40 hrs/2yr | Equal |

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] Nevada represents the **SECOND HIGHEST total DO biennial requirement** (80 hrs) among split-board states, behind only Maine (100 hrs), and the **HIGHEST MD/DO disparity** (2X difference within same state).

## 15. Appendix: Uncovered Topics

### Topics Researched But Not Included (Out-of-Scope)

The following topics were researched to determine applicability but are documented here as NOT INCLUDED in renewal requirements per scope limitations:

**Initial Licensing Examinations (COMLEX, USMLE)**
- Status: Out-of-scope (covered in initial licensing rubric)
- Finding: COMLEX-USA or USMLE required for initial DO licensure, not applicable to renewal
- Relevance: Initial licensure only, no renewal impact

**Osteopathic Medical School Accreditation (AOA-COCA)**
- Status: Out-of-scope (applies only to initial licensure)
- Finding: Commission on Osteopathic College Accreditation (COCA) accredits osteopathic medical schools
- Relevance: Initial education requirement, no renewal impact

**Postgraduate Training Requirements (Residency/Fellowship)**
- Status: Out-of-scope for general renewal (initial licensure requirement)
- Finding: ACGME or AOA-accredited residency required for initial licensure in most states
- Relevance: Initial licensure, but CRITICAL GAP for renewal CME credit during training

**Physician Assistant Requirements**
- Status: Out-of-scope (separate license type)
- Finding: Nevada Board of Osteopathic Medicine also regulates PAs
- Relevance: PA CME requirements differ from DO requirements (20 hrs annually per FSMB)

**Anesthesiologist Assistant Requirements**
- Status: Out-of-scope (separate license type)
- Finding: Nevada Board of Osteopathic Medicine regulates AAs
- Relevance: Separate licensure track, not applicable to DO renewals

### Additional Information Discovered (For Future Consideration)

During research, the following information was discovered that may be relevant for future CREDMATE enhancements but falls outside current scope:

**AB 56 (2025) Implementation Timeline**
- **Topic:** Detailed transition mechanics from annual to biennial renewal
- **Relevance:** Critical for DOs renewing in 2025-2026 transition period
- **Source:** AB 56 full text, board implementation guidance (not yet published)
- **Recommendation:** Monitor board website for implementation timeline publication in late 2025

**Thentia Cloud Portal Features**
- **Topic:** Online portal capabilities (CME tracking, transcript access, auto-renewal)
- **Relevance:** May provide CME tracking features not documented in statutes
- **Source:** Licensee portal (login required)
- **Recommendation:** Request demo account or contact Thentia to determine portal CME features

**PDMP (Prescription Drug Monitoring Program) Integration**
- **Topic:** Nevada PDMP training or usage requirements for prescribers
- **Relevance:** May affect controlled substance prescribing CME requirements
- **Source:** Separate Nevada PDMP statute (outside NRS 633)
- **Recommendation:** Research Nevada PDMP statute and contact PDMP administrator

**Federal MATE Act Interaction**
- **Topic:** How federal 8-hour opioid training requirement interacts with state 2-hour requirement
- **Relevance:** DOs with DEA registration need clarity on dual requirements
- **Source:** Federal MATE Act (2022), DEA regulations
- **Recommendation:** Clarify with board whether MATE Act training satisfies state requirement

**Maine Comparison (Highest Total Hours)**
- **Topic:** Maine requires 100 hrs/2yr for DOs (higher total than Nevada's 80 hrs/2yr)
- **Relevance:** Nevada has highest MD/DO disparity, but Maine has highest total DO requirement
- **Recommendation:** Cross-reference Maine DO research for shared challenges

**Osteopathic Education 40-Hour Minimum (Maine Model)**
- **Topic:** Maine requires 40 hrs minimum osteopathic education for DOs
- **Relevance:** Nevada requires 10 hrs Category 1-A (osteopathic or ACCME), much lower than Maine
- **Recommendation:** Consider whether Nevada may adopt similar osteopathic minimum in future
