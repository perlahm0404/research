## 1. Board Information & Regulatory Authority

[FACT - BOARD] The West Virginia Board of Medicine is the official regulatory agency for allopathic physicians (MDs) in West Virginia.

**Contact Information:**
- Website: https://wvbom.wv.gov
- Phone: (304) 558-2921
- Email: wvbom@wv.gov
- Address: 101 Dee Drive, Suite 103, Charleston, WV 25311

### Primary Statutory Framework

[FACT - STATUTE] W. Va. Code § 30-3-14 governs continuing medical education requirements for West Virginia MD physicians.

[FACT - ADMIN_CODE] W. Va. CSR § 11-1B provides detailed CME implementation requirements.

### Split-Board State

[FACT - STATUTE] West Virginia maintains separate boards:
- **MD Board:** West Virginia Board of Medicine (WVBOM) - 50 hrs/2yr
- **DO Board:** West Virginia Board of Osteopathic Medicine (WVBOOM) - 32 hrs/2yr

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] **REVERSE PATTERN:** MD requires MORE hours than DO (50 vs 32), which is opposite of typical split-board states where DO requirements equal or exceed MD requirements. This is unusual nationally.

---

## 2. CME Requirements - Total Hours & Categories

[FACT - ADMIN_CODE] West Virginia requires **50 hours of CME every 2 years** (biennial renewal), **all Category 1**.

Citation: W. Va. CSR § 11-1B
Annual Equivalent: 25 hours per year

### Category Specification

[FACT - ADMIN_CODE] All 50 hours must be **AMA Category 1** or equivalent.
- No Category 2 hours accepted
- All hours must be from ACCME-accredited or board-recognized providers

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] West Virginia's requirement for 100% Category 1 is more restrictive than states that accept mixed categories.

### Specialty Area Requirement (30 Hours)

[FACT - ADMIN_CODE] Of the 50 total hours, **30 hours must be in the physician's specialty area**.

[HIGH GAP] How "specialty area" is defined and verified is not explicitly documented. Presumed to align with board certification specialty or primary practice area.

**Verification Needed:** Contact WV Board of Medicine to clarify specialty area definition and documentation requirements.

**Remaining 20 Hours:** General medical education (any Category 1 topic)

---

## 3. Mandatory Topics

### Controlled Substance Training (3 Hours)

[FACT - STATUTE] All physicians must complete **3 hours of Board risk assessment and controlled substance training** per biennial cycle.

Citation: W. Va. Code § 30-3-13a
Frequency: Every 2 years
Applicability: All licensed physicians

**Content:**
- Controlled substance prescribing best practices
- Risk assessment for substance use disorder
- Drug diversion prevention
- PDMP usage
- Board regulations on controlled substances

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] The 3 hours of controlled substance training are **included within** the 50-hour total requirement, not in addition to it.

### Other Mandatory Topics

[CRITICAL GAP] No other mandatory topic-specific CME requirements found beyond controlled substance training.

**Common topics NOT required:**
- Child abuse recognition (NOT REQUIRED)
- Cultural competency (NOT REQUIRED)
- Opioid-specific CME beyond general controlled substance (NOT DOCUMENTED)
- Health equity (NOT REQUIRED)

---

## 4. Teaching & Preceptorship Credit

### Medical Student Teaching Credit

[FACT - ADMIN_CODE] Physicians may receive **up to 20 hours of CME credit** for teaching or precepting medical students.

**Acceptable Activities:**
- Medical school teaching
- Residency teaching
- Clinical preceptorship for medical students
- Structured educational supervision

[MEDIUM GAP] Calculation method (hours taught vs CME hours awarded) and documentation requirements not explicitly specified.

**Integration with Total Hours:**
[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] Teaching credit counts toward the 50-hour total requirement and may count toward the 30-hour specialty requirement if teaching is in the physician's specialty.

**Verification Needed:** Contact WV Board of Medicine for teaching credit calculation formula and required documentation.

---

## 5. Exemptions & Alternatives

### MOC Alternative (ABMS)

[FACT - ADMIN_CODE] Physicians participating in **ABMS Maintenance of Certification (MOC) programs** may satisfy CME requirements.

**Accepted Boards:**
- American Board of Medical Specialties (ABMS) MOC

**Scope:** MOC participation provides alternative to 50-hour requirement

[MEDIUM GAP] Whether MOC provides complete exemption or partial credit is not explicitly documented.

### Postgraduate Training Alternative

[FACT - ADMIN_CODE] Physicians in postgraduate training (residency/fellowship) may receive CME credit or exemption.

[CRITICAL GAP] Specific credit amount or exemption scope not documented.

**Verification Needed:** Contact WV Board of Medicine to clarify postgraduate training credit/exemption.

---

## 6. Renewal Timeline & Fees

[FACT - BOARD] West Virginia medical licenses are renewed **biennially (every 2 years)**.

**Renewal Fee:** [HIGH GAP - not specified in accessible sources]
**Late Renewal Fee:** [HIGH GAP - not specified in accessible sources]

**Grace Period:** [MEDIUM GAP - grace period details not documented]

**Verification Needed:** Contact WV Board of Medicine at (304) 558-2921 for current fee schedule and grace period details.

---

## 7. Audit & Verification

[FACT - BOARD] West Virginia conducts **audits** of CME compliance.

[HIGH GAP] Audit frequency, selection methodology, and response timeline not specified in accessible sources.

**Audit Documentation:**
- CME certificates showing provider, hours, category, dates
- MOC participation records (if applicable)
- Teaching documentation (if claiming teaching credit)

**Verification Needed:** Contact WV Board of Medicine for audit procedures and timeline.

## 8. Split-Board Comparison: MD vs DO

| Factor | MD (WVBOM) | DO (WVBOOM) |
|--------|------------|-------------|
| Total Hours | 50 hrs/2yr | 32 hrs/2yr |
| Annual Equivalent | 25 hrs/yr | 16 hrs/yr |
| Category Requirement | All Category 1 | 16 hrs AOA Cat 1A/1B |
| Specialty Requirement | 30 hrs in specialty | [Research needed] |
| Controlled Substance | 3 hrs per cycle | 3 hrs per cycle |
| Teaching Credit | Up to 20 hrs | [Research needed] |
| MOC Alternative | ABMS MOC | [Research needed] |
| **Difference** | **MD requires 56% MORE hours** | **DO lower burden** |

### Key Finding: REVERSE PATTERN

[FACT - ADMIN_CODE] West Virginia is one of the **only states nationally** where MD physicians have a HIGHER CME burden than DO physicians.

**Typical Pattern:**
- Most split-board states: DO requirements equal or exceed MD requirements
- Example: Oklahoma MD 60/3yr (20/yr) vs DO 16/yr (MD higher but similar annual rate)
- Example: Maine MD 40/2yr vs DO 100/2yr (DO dramatically higher)

**West Virginia Pattern:**
- MD: 50 hrs/2yr (25 hrs/yr)
- DO: 32 hrs/2yr (16 hrs/yr)
- **MD requires 56% MORE hours than DO**

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] This reverse pattern may reflect different board philosophies on CME quantity vs quality, or historical regulatory development.

## 9. Research Gaps

### HIGH GAPS
- Specialty area definition and verification (affects 30-hour requirement)
- Renewal fees and late fees
- Grace period details
- Audit frequency and procedures

### MEDIUM GAPS
- Teaching credit calculation and documentation
- MOC exemption scope (full vs partial)
- Postgraduate training credit/exemption
- Newly licensed physician grace period

### LOW GAPS
- Hardship exemption procedures
- Military service exemption
- CME documentation retention period

## Conclusion

West Virginia's MD license renewal requirements are **TIER 2** due to:
- **Split-board with reverse pattern:** MD 50 hrs vs DO 32 hrs (MD 56% higher - unusual nationally)
- **All Category 1 requirement:** No mixed categories accepted
- **Specialty area requirement:** 30 hours must be in specialty (60% of total)
- **Teaching credit option:** Up to 20 hours for medical student teaching
- **Moderate total hours:** 50 hrs/2yr (25 hrs/yr) - mid-range nationally

**For Physician Compliance:**
1. Track 50 hours Category 1 CME over 2-year cycle
2. Ensure 30 hours are in specialty area
3. Complete 3 hours controlled substance training per cycle
4. Consider teaching credit (up to 20 hours if applicable)
5. Consider ABMS MOC as alternative (verify exemption scope)
6. Renew biennially through WV Board portal

**Reverse Pattern Significance:** West Virginia MD physicians have higher CME burden than DO physicians (50 vs 32 hours), which is opposite of typical split-board states. This creates unique compliance consideration for physicians practicing in multiple states.

**Annual Rate:** 25 hours/year (MD) vs 16 hours/year (DO) - 56% higher burden for MDs
