| **GA** | 153 lines, 68% | 450 lines, 85% | 5 hrs | 2 - HIGH | Pain clinic requirements critical for rules engine |
| **ID** | 149 lines, 68% | 450 lines, 85% | 4-5 hrs | 3 - HIGH | Board cert exemption already excellent, needs context |
| **HI** | 153 lines, 67% | 450 lines, 85% | 5 hrs | 4 - HIGH | Category restriction well-documented, needs expansion |
| **KS** | 143 lines, 66% | 450 lines, 85% | 5-6 hrs | 5 - HIGH | Flexible renewal unique, needs comprehensive treatment |

## RISK MITIGATION

### Risk 1: Information Not Available
**Mitigation:** Document 3+ search attempts, mark as [CRITICAL GAP], note impact on rules engine, recommend board contact

### Risk 2: Time Overruns
**Mitigation:** Prioritize high-value states first (KY, GA, MS, NH), accept 85% standard instead of pushing to 95%

### Risk 3: Statute Changes During Research
**Mitigation:** Include "last_verified" date in frontmatter, note "effective date" for new requirements

### Risk 4: Conflicting Sources
**Mitigation:** Document conflict in cross-source validation, prioritize: Statute > Admin Code > Board Website > FSMB

Quote: "The Board may conduct random audits of licensee CME compliance..."

[FACT - BOARD] Renewal portal opens 60 days before expiration
Source: https://www.albme.gov/renewal | Accessed: 2026-01-02

[INFERENCE - HIGH] License renewal cycle is triennial (every 3 years)
Reasoning: CME requirement cycle (3 years per statute) matches renewal frequency documented on board website

[CRITICAL GAP] CME record retention period unknown
Search attempts:
1. Ala. Code § 34-24-75 (searched "retention" - not found)
2. Ala. Admin. Code r. 540-X-14.02 (searched "retention" and "records" - not found)
3. Board FAQ (https://www.albme.gov/faq - page reviewed, not documented)
