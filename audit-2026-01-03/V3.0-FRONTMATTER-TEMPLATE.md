# v3.0 Frontmatter Template for State Medical License Renewal Research
## Template Version: 1.0 | Created: 2026-01-03

**Purpose:** This template provides the complete frontmatter structure required for v3.0 compliance (100-point audit rubric). Apply this template to all state medical license renewal research documents to achieve GOOD (85%+) audit scores.

**Impact:** Adding complete v3.0 frontmatter increases audit scores by +15 to +18 points.

## TEMPLATE NOTES

### Required Sections (100% compliance needed)
1. ✅ **governance:** Framework, authority, statutes, admin code
2. ✅ **soc2_compliance:** Data classification, controls, retention
3. ✅ **iso_standards:** Applicable standards, quality objectives
4. ✅ **scope:** included/excluded arrays with clear boundaries
5. ✅ **critical_gaps/high_gaps/medium_gaps:** Populated from document gaps
6. ✅ **tier_classification:** Rationale with key_indicators
7. ✅ **research_quality:** Metrics and validation tracking

### Conditional Sections
- **split_board_state/partner:** Only for TIER-2 split-board states
- **split_board_note:** Only for MD-only or DO-only documents in split-board states

### Audit Impact
Adding complete v3.0 frontmatter:
- **Frontmatter Structure (Phase 1):** +15 to +18 points
- **Evidence Classification (Phase 3):** +2 points (gap arrays support evidence)
- **Total Impact:** +17 to +20 points average

### Application Priority
**Priority 1 (6 documents, 75-79/100):**
- Maryland MD, Florida MD, Delaware MD, Kentucky MD, Hawaii MD, Kansas MD
- Goal: Move to 85-90/100 (GOOD to EXCELLENT)

**Priority 2 (17 documents, 70-74/100):**
- Georgia MD, Idaho MD, Arizona DO, California DO, etc.
- Goal: Move to 85-88/100 (GOOD)

**Priority 3 (45 documents, <70/100):**
- All v1.0/v2.0 documents
- Goal: Move to 70%+ (FAIR)

## CUSTOMIZATION INSTRUCTIONS

For each state document:

1. **Replace all `[PLACEHOLDERS]`** with state-specific values
2. **Populate gap arrays** by extracting all [CRITICAL GAP], [HIGH GAP], [MEDIUM GAP] tags from document body
3. **Update tier_classification** with state-specific complexity indicators
4. **Verify governance statutes** match document body citations
5. **Confirm scope arrays** accurately reflect document coverage
6. **Add version_history** entry documenting frontmatter upgrade
