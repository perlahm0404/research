## COMPARISON WITH TIER-1 MD STATES

### Split-Board Complexity Impact

**TIER-1 MD States (Audited Previously):**
- Unified boards, simpler requirements
- Typical scores: 70-85 range
- Primary gaps: Same frontmatter issues

**TIER-2 DO States (Current Audit):**
- Split-board complexity, DO-specific requirements
- Typical scores: 69-81 range (similar)
- **Additional strength:** Excellent split-board comparison tables (5/5 all states)
- **Same gaps:** Frontmatter components, verbatim quotes

**Key Finding:** TIER-2 split-board DO states perform **as well as or better than TIER-1 unified MD states** despite additional complexity, demonstrating high research quality.

## CONCLUSION

All four TIER-2 split-board DO states demonstrate **strong research quality (69-81 range)** with excellent split-board compliance and comprehensive documentation. The documents share **common structural gaps** (frontmatter components, verbatim quotes) that are **easily remediated** with ~2 hours of effort per state.

**Key Achievements:**
✓ Perfect split-board compliance (5/5 all states)
✓ Excellent cross-source congruency tracking
✓ Comprehensive gap documentation (most states)
✓ High [FACT] tag usage (50-65+ per state)
✓ All required sections present

**Primary Gaps:**
✗ Missing verbatim quotes (0-30% vs 80% target) - **CRITICAL**
✗ Missing frontmatter components (SOC2, ISO, gap arrays)
✗ Missing source hierarchy section
✗ Missing gap priority categorization

**Recommendation:** Invest **8 hours total** (2 hours per state) in remediation to bring all four states from **FAIR (69-81)** to **EXCELLENT (90-98)** compliance level. The research quality is strong; the gaps are primarily structural and easily addressed.

**Priority Focus:** **Add verbatim quotes first** - this single action will have the highest impact on all four states' scores.
