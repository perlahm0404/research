- **Complete:** 7/12 (58%)
- **Missing:** 5/12 (42%)

**43 Unified-Board Jurisdictions:** Same board regulates both MD and DO with same/similar requirements
- **Complete:** 0/43 (0%)

## KEY DIFFERENCES: SPLIT vs UNIFIED BOARDS

### Split-Board States (12)
**Characteristics:**
- Completely separate regulatory boards for MD and DO
- Different CME hour requirements (sometimes dramatically different)
- Different renewal cycles (annual vs biennial vs triennial)
- Different mandatory topics
- Different renewal fees
- Different renewal dates
- Sometimes different regulatory agencies

**Research Requirement:**
- **Full independent research required** (6-8 hours per state)
- Cannot infer DO from MD
- Must research separate statutes, admin codes, board policies

**Examples of Dramatic Differences:**
- Nevada: MD 40 hrs/2yr vs DO **40 hrs/YEAR** (2x frequency!)
- Maine: MD 40 hrs/2yr vs DO **100 hrs/2yr** (2.5x hours!)
- Oklahoma: MD 60 hrs/3yr vs DO **16 hrs/yr** (completely different structure)
- Florida: Different renewal dates (MD birthday vs DO March 31)
- Vermont: Different regulatory agencies (Dept of Health vs Secretary of State)

---

### Unified-Board States (43)
**Characteristics:**
- Single board regulates both MD and DO physicians
- **Same CME hour requirements** for both license types
- **Same renewal cycle** for both
- **Same mandatory topics** for both
- **Same renewal fees** for both
- **Same renewal dates** for both

**Research Requirement:**
- **Can be derived from MD research** (30 mins per state)
- Document MD research applies to DO with nuances noted
- Research only nuances, not full requirements

**Typical Nuances (Usually Minor):**
1. **CME Category Acceptance:**
   - MDs use AMA Category 1 credits
   - DOs can use AOA Category 1-A/1-B credits (functionally equivalent)
   - Unified boards typically accept both

2. **Board Certification:**
   - MDs certified by ABMS specialty boards
   - DOs certified by AOA-BOS specialty boards
   - Unified boards typically accept both for exemptions/credits

3. **Professional Recognition:**
   - AMA PRA (Physician's Recognition Award) for MDs
   - AOA CME certification for DOs
   - Unified boards typically recognize both

4. **Residency Training:**
   - ACGME-accredited programs (allopathic/MD)
   - AOA-accredited programs (osteopathic/DO)
   - Unified boards typically accept both for CME credit

5. **Osteopathic Education:**
   - Some unified boards may note that DOs can take osteopathic-focused CME
   - But not required - DOs can also take standard AMA CME

**Example: Texas (Unified Board)**
- Texas Medical Board regulates both MD and DO
- Requirements: 48 hrs/2yr (24 formal Cat 1, 24 informal) - **SAME for both MD and DO**
- Renewal cycle: Biennial - **SAME for both**
- Fees: **SAME for both**
- Mandatory topics: **SAME for both**
- **DO-specific nuance:** DOs can use AOA Category 1-A credits instead of AMA Category 1

## UPDATED EFFORT ESTIMATES

### Split-Board DO Research (5 remaining states)
- **States:** ME, MI, OK, WA, WV (Nevada complete ✅)
- **Effort per state:** 6-8 hours (full research from statutes, admin codes, board sources)
- **Total effort:** 30-40 hours
- **Priority:** **CRITICAL** - Cannot be derived from MD

### Unified-Board DO Generation (43 missing states)
- **States:** All 43 unified jurisdictions listed above
- **Effort per state:** 30 minutes (copy MD document, update frontmatter, add nuance section)
- **Total effort:** 21.5 hours
- **Priority:** **LOW-MEDIUM** - Can wait until split-boards complete

**Total DO Coverage Effort:**
- Split-boards: 30-40 hours (CRITICAL) - 5 remaining states
- Unified-boards: 21.5 hours (LOW-MEDIUM)
- **Grand total: 51.5-61.5 hours to 100% DO coverage**

## CORRECTED PRIORITIZATION

### Phase 1: Critical Split-Board DO Research (30-40 hours)
**Immediate Priority - Cannot be deferred:**

1. **Michigan DO** (6-8 hours)
   - Large state, medium DO population (~1,500 DOs)
   - Different Category 1 requirements (75 MD vs 60 DO)

2. **Oklahoma DO** (6-8 hours)
   - Dramatically different structure (60/3yr MD vs 16/yr DO)
   - Tracker notes suggest verification needed

3. **Washington DO** (6-8 hours)
   - Different cycles entirely (4yr MD vs 3yr DO)
   - Large state, medium DO population

4. **Maine DO** (6-8 hours)
   - Largest hour difference (40 MD vs 100 DO - 2.5x!)

5. **West Virginia DO** (6-8 hours)
   - Reverse pattern (MD higher than DO)

✅ **Nevada DO COMPLETE** (85%, 2026-01-03) - HIGHEST MD/DO CME DISPARITY IN US

**Deliverable:** 5 comprehensive DO research documents (v3.0 compliant)

---

### Phase 2: High-Volume Unified-Board DO Generation (3 hours)
**Secondary Priority - Quick wins for large states:**

1. Texas DO (30 mins) - Largest state
2. New York DO (30 mins) - Large state, TIER-3
3. Illinois DO (30 mins) - Large state, TIER-3
4. Ohio DO (30 mins) - Large unified state
5. North Carolina DO (30 mins) - TIER-3
6. New Jersey DO (30 mins) - TIER-3

**Deliverable:** 6 derived DO documents for high-volume states

---

### Phase 3: Remaining Unified-Board DO Generation (18.5 hours)
**Deferred Priority - Complete coverage:**

- All remaining 37 unified-board jurisdictions
- **Deliverable:** 37 derived DO documents
- **Result:** 100% DO coverage across all 55 jurisdictions

### Week 1-2: Split-Board DO Research Priority
1. Research Michigan DO (6-8 hrs)
2. Research Oklahoma DO (6-8 hrs)
~~3. Research Nevada DO (6-8 hrs)~~ ✅ **COMPLETE** (85%, 2026-01-03)

**Deliverable:** 2 new split-board DO documents

### Week 3: Complete Remaining Split-Boards
3. Research Washington DO (6-8 hrs)
4. Research Maine DO (6-8 hrs)

## SUMMARY - CORRECTED UNDERSTANDING

| Category | Count | Status | Effort | Priority |
|----------|-------|--------|--------|----------|
| **Split-board DO (missing)** | 5 | ❌ CRITICAL GAP | 30-40 hrs | **HIGHEST** |
| **Split-board DO (complete)** | 7 | ✅ DONE | - | - |
| **Unified DO (high-volume)** | 6 | ❌ Missing | 3 hrs | **MEDIUM** |
| **Unified DO (remaining)** | 37 | ❌ Missing | 18.5 hrs | **LOW** |
| **TOTAL** | **55** | **12.7% complete** | **51.5-61.5 hrs** | - |

**Key Insight:** The DO coverage gap is **less severe than initially assessed** because 43/48 missing documents can be **derived from MD research** quickly (30 mins each) rather than requiring full re-research.

**True Critical Gap:** Only **5 split-board states** remain requiring full research (30-40 hours total). Nevada DO completed 2026-01-03 with 85% completion, documenting the HIGHEST MD/DO CME DISPARITY in the United States.
