## 1. Board Information & Regulatory Authority

### Official Board Information

[FACT - BOARD] The Iowa Board of Medicine is the official regulatory agency for allopathic physicians in Iowa. Website: https://medicalboard.iowa.gov/. Phone: (515) 281-5171. (Accessed 2026-01-02)

[FACT - STATUTE] The Iowa Board of Medicine's authority derives from Iowa Code Chapter 148 (Practice of Medicine and Surgery).

### Primary Statutory Framework

[FACT - STATUTE] Iowa Code Chapter 148 establishes the statutory foundation for medical licensure and license renewal in Iowa.

[FACT - ADMIN_CODE] Iowa Administrative Code 653-13 provides detailed regulations for continuing education requirements.

[FACT - BOARD] Iowa operates a unified board structure for MD and DO physicians (Iowa Board of Medicine regulates both).

---

## 2. Renewal Cycle & Dates

### Biennial Renewal Schedule

[FACT - STATUTE] Iowa physicians renew their medical licenses every 2 years (biennial renewal cycle).

[CRITICAL GAP] Specific renewal deadline dates (month/day), renewal window timeframes, and whether renewal is based on birth month or a fixed date are not documented in available materials.

### Renewal Timeline & Submission Windows

[CRITICAL GAP] The exact timeline for when physicians may begin renewal before expiration, notification procedures, and submission windows are not documented in available research materials.

[RECOMMENDATION] Contact the Iowa Board of Medicine at (515) 281-5171 for specific renewal timeline and deadline information.

### Grace Period & Late Renewal

[CRITICAL GAP] Grace period mechanics, late fees, and consequences of missed renewal deadlines are not documented in available materials.

---

## 3. CME Requirements - Base Hours & Categories

### Total CME Hours Required

[FACT - STATUTE] Iowa requires 40 hours of continuing medical education every 2 years (biennial cycle).

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] This is a standard biennial requirement comparable to many other states (e.g., Delaware, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho).

### Carryover Provisions

[FACT - STATUTE] Iowa allows physicians to carry over UP TO 20 HOURS of excess CME credits from the previous 2-year cycle to the current cycle.

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] This means:
- If a physician completes 60 hours in Cycle 1, they can carry forward 20 hours to Cycle 2
- Cycle 2 would then require only 20 additional hours (20 carried + 20 new = 40 total)
- Maximum carryover is capped at 20 hours (cannot carry more even if more excess hours exist)

[CRITICAL GAP] Whether carryover hours must be from specific categories (e.g., formal vs. informal) or can be any CME type is not documented.

### CME Categories & Formats

[CRITICAL GAP] Whether Iowa requires specific categories of CME (e.g., AMA PRA Category 1, AOA Category 1-A) or accepts all CME formats (Category 1, Category 2, informal) is not documented in available materials.

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] Based on typical state practice, Iowa likely accepts:
- AMA PRA Category 1 Credit
- AOA Category 1-A Credit
- Possibly informal CME or Category 2 (to be verified)

[RECOMMENDATION] Contact the Iowa Board of Medicine to clarify acceptable CME categories and formats.

---

## 4. CME Topic Requirements - Mandatory Topics

### Overview of Mandatory Topics

[FACT - STATUTE] Iowa has multiple mandatory CME topics with varying cycle frequencies: 3-year cycles and 5-year cycles.

### Topic 1: Child Abuse (2 hours every 3 years, MANDATORY)

[FACT - STATUTE] All Iowa physicians must complete 2 hours of continuing education on **child abuse identification and reporting** every 3 years.

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] This is a per-3-year-cycle requirement, meaning:
- Renewal 1 (Year 0-2): 2 hours child abuse required
- Renewal 2 (Year 2-4): 2 hours child abuse required
- Renewal 3 (Year 4-6): 2 hours child abuse required
- Pattern repeats every 3-year cycle

[CRITICAL GAP] Whether the 3-year cycle aligns with every other renewal (since renewal is biennial) or has a separate tracking period is not documented. The interaction between 2-year renewal cycles and 3-year topic cycles creates potential complexity.

**Example Scenario:**
- 2-year renewal cycle: Years 0-2, 2-4, 4-6, 6-8
- 3-year topic cycle: Years 0-3, 3-6, 6-9
- Alignment varies depending on tracking method

[RECOMMENDATION] Clarify with Iowa Board of Medicine how 3-year topic cycles align with 2-year renewal cycles.

### Topic 2: Adult Abuse (2 hours every 3 years, MANDATORY)

[FACT - STATUTE] All Iowa physicians must complete 2 hours of continuing education on **adult abuse (including dependent adult abuse) identification and reporting** every 3 years.

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] This follows the same 3-year cycle structure as child abuse (2 hours every 3 years).

[CRITICAL GAP] Same alignment question as child abuse - how does the 3-year cycle interact with the 2-year renewal cycle?

### Topic 3: Opioid CDC Guidelines (2 hours every 5 years, MANDATORY)

[FACT - STATUTE] All Iowa physicians must complete 2 hours of continuing education on **CDC opioid prescribing guidelines** every 5 years.

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] This is a longer-cycle requirement (5 years) compared to child/adult abuse (3 years).

**Example 5-Year Cycle Alignment:**
- 2-year renewal cycle: Years 0-2, 2-4, 4-6, 6-8, 8-10
- 5-year topic cycle: Years 0-5, 5-10, 10-15
- Opioid education would be due at specific renewals depending on when the 5-year cycle was last completed

[CRITICAL GAP] How the 5-year opioid cycle tracks against 2-year renewals is not documented. Does the board track a continuous 5-year window, or does it reset at specific renewals?

### Topic 4: End-of-Life Care (1 hour every 5 years, MANDATORY)

[FACT - STATUTE] All Iowa physicians must complete 1 hour of continuing education on **end-of-life care** every 5 years.

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] This follows the same 5-year cycle as opioid CDC guidelines but requires only 1 hour instead of 2.

[CRITICAL GAP] Same 5-year cycle alignment question as opioid requirement.

### Summary of Mandatory Topics & Timing

| Topic | Hours | Cycle | Applicability |
|-------|-------|-------|---------------|
| Child Abuse | 2 hrs | Every 3 years | All physicians |
| Adult Abuse | 2 hrs | Every 3 years | All physicians |
| Opioid CDC Guidelines | 2 hrs | Every 5 years | All physicians |
| End-of-Life Care | 1 hr | Every 5 years | All physicians |

**Total Specialty Topic Hours (variable by cycle):**
- Every 2-year renewal: May include 0-7 hours depending on 3-year and 5-year cycle alignment
- Every 3 years: 4 hours (child abuse + adult abuse)
- Every 5 years: 3 hours (opioid + end-of-life)

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] The overlapping cycles create variable requirements at each renewal. Some renewals may have 0 specialty topic hours due (if all cycles were completed recently), while others may have up to 7 hours due (if 3-year and 5-year cycles align).

---

## 5. Board Certification & Alternative Compliance

### ABMS/AOA Board Certification Alternative

[FACT - STATUTE] The Iowa Board of Medicine accepts **ABMS or AOA board certification or recertification** as equivalent to 50 hours of CME.

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] This means:
- If a physician completes ABMS board certification or recertification within the 2-year renewal cycle, they receive credit for 50 hours
- Since the requirement is 40 hours per cycle, board certification provides MORE than the required hours (50 vs. 40)
- The excess 10 hours could potentially be carried over (up to 20-hour carryover cap)

[CRITICAL GAP] Whether board certification:
- Provides a FULL exemption from the 40-hour requirement?
- Provides 50 hours of credit (requiring no additional CME)?
- Exempts from specialty topic requirements (child abuse, adult abuse, opioid, end-of-life)?

[RECOMMENDATION] Clarify with Iowa Board of Medicine:
1. Does ABMS/AOA certification provide full exemption or 50-hour credit?
2. Are specialty topics still required even with board certification?
3. Can the excess 10 hours (50 credit - 40 requirement) be carried over?

### Resident Training Alternative

[FACT - STATUTE] The Iowa Board of Medicine accepts **ABMS or AOA resident training** as equivalent to continuing education.

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] Physicians actively participating in accredited residency or fellowship programs may have their training hours count toward CME requirements.

[CRITICAL GAP] Specific details on resident training credit:
- How many hours of training = how many CME hours?
- Does resident training provide full exemption or partial credit?
- Which types of residency/fellowship programs qualify?

---

## 6. Exemptions & Special Circumstances

### Board Certification Exemption

[FACT - STATUTE] ABMS or AOA board certification/recertification provides an alternative compliance pathway (equivalent to 50 hours).

[CRITICAL GAP] Whether this is a full exemption or partial credit is not documented (see Section 5 above).

### Resident Training Exemption

[FACT - STATUTE] Physicians in ABMS or AOA accredited residency or fellowship training may have an alternative compliance pathway.

[CRITICAL GAP] Details of resident exemption not documented.

### First-Time Renewal

[CRITICAL GAP] Whether newly licensed physicians are exempt from CME requirements for their first renewal is not documented.

### Other Exemptions

[CRITICAL GAP] Whether exemptions exist for:
- Retired physicians
- Inactive licenses
- Military service
- Hardship circumstances

These are not documented in available materials.

---

## 7. Regulatory Timeline & Effective Dates

### Current Requirements Status

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] The specialty topic requirements (child abuse, adult abuse, opioid CDC guidelines, end-of-life care) are currently in effect based on FSMB data.

[CRITICAL GAP] The specific effective dates for each specialty topic requirement are not documented in available materials.

**Timeline of Iowa MD CME Regulatory Changes:**

| Date | Requirement | Status | Reference |
|------|-------------|--------|-----------|
| [Date TBD] | 40 hours/2yr baseline | EFFECTIVE | 653 IAC 13 |
| [Date TBD] | Child abuse 2 hrs/3yr | EFFECTIVE | 653 IAC 13 |
| [Date TBD] | Adult abuse 2 hrs/3yr | EFFECTIVE | 653 IAC 13 |
| [Date TBD] | Opioid CDC guidelines 2 hrs/5yr | EFFECTIVE | 653 IAC 13 |
| [Date TBD] | End-of-life care 1 hr/5yr | EFFECTIVE | 653 IAC 13 |
| [Date TBD] | Carryover up to 20 hours | EFFECTIVE | 653 IAC 13 |
| [Date TBD] | Board cert alternative (50 hrs) | EFFECTIVE | 653 IAC 13 |

[RECOMMENDATION] Research Iowa Administrative Code 653-13 directly to obtain effective dates for each requirement.

---

## 8. CME Tracking & Compliance Verification

### Documentation Requirements

[CRITICAL GAP] Specific documentation requirements (certificates, transcripts, self-attestation, etc.) are not documented in available materials.

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] Based on typical state practice, physicians likely must:
- Maintain certificates of completion for all CME
- Provide documentation upon request or during audit
- Retain records for a specified period (e.g., 5-7 years)

### Audit Procedures

[CRITICAL GAP] Whether the Iowa Board of Medicine conducts audits of CME compliance, and if so, the frequency and procedures, is not documented in available materials.

[RECOMMENDATION] Contact the Iowa Board of Medicine to clarify audit procedures and documentation retention requirements.

---

## 9. Renewal Procedures & Fees

### Standard Renewal Process

[FACT - BOARD] Iowa physicians renew through the Iowa Board of Medicine online portal (URL to be verified).

[CRITICAL GAP] The exact renewal portal URL, submission procedures, and renewal window details are not documented in available materials beyond the general board website.

### Renewal Fees

[CRITICAL GAP] The specific renewal fee amount for Iowa medical licenses is not documented in available research materials.

### Grace Period & Late Renewal

[CRITICAL GAP] Grace period mechanics, late fees, and consequences of expired licenses are not documented in available materials.

---

## 10. Complexity of Multi-Cycle Topic Requirements

### 2-Year, 3-Year, and 5-Year Cycle Interactions

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] Iowa's CME structure creates variable requirements at each renewal due to overlapping cycles:

**Base Requirement:** 40 hours every 2 years
**Specialty Topics:**
- 3-year cycle: 4 hours (2 child abuse + 2 adult abuse)
- 5-year cycle: 3 hours (2 opioid + 1 end-of-life)

**Example Compliance Timeline (Hypothetical):**

| Renewal Period | Base CME | Child/Adult Abuse (3yr) | Opioid/End-of-Life (5yr) | Total |
|----------------|----------|-------------------------|--------------------------|-------|
| Year 0-2 | 40 hrs | 4 hrs (due) | 0 hrs (not due) | 44 hrs |
| Year 2-4 | 40 hrs | 0 hrs (not due) | 0 hrs (not due) | 40 hrs |
| Year 4-6 | 40 hrs | 4 hrs (due) | 3 hrs (due) | 47 hrs |
| Year 6-8 | 40 hrs | 0 hrs (not due) | 0 hrs (not due) | 40 hrs |
| Year 8-10 | 40 hrs | 4 hrs (due) | 0 hrs (not due) | 44 hrs |
| Year 10-12 | 40 hrs | 0 hrs (not due) | 3 hrs (due) | 43 hrs |

[CRITICAL - COMPLEXITY] The interaction between 2-year, 3-year, and 5-year cycles creates variable requirements that must be tracked separately. This is a source of complexity for physicians and requires careful cycle management.

[RECOMMENDATION] Physicians should maintain a tracking spreadsheet showing:
1. Last completion date for each specialty topic
2. Next due date for each specialty topic
3. Which renewal cycles will have specialty topic requirements

---

## Conclusion

Iowa MD license renewal requirements are **straightforward with moderate complexity** (TIER 1) due to overlapping 2-year, 3-year, and 5-year cycles for specialty topics.

**Core Requirements Summary:**
- 40 hours CME per 2-year cycle
- Carryover: up to 20 hours from previous cycle
- Specialty topics: Child abuse (2 hrs/3yr), adult abuse (2 hrs/3yr), opioid CDC guidelines (2 hrs/5yr), end-of-life (1 hr/5yr)
- Board certification alternative: ABMS/AOA equivalent to 50 hours
- Resident training: ABMS/AOA training may provide credit

**Key Complexity Factors:**
1. Overlapping 2-year renewal, 3-year topic, and 5-year topic cycles
2. Variable specialty topic requirements at each renewal (0-7 hours depending on cycle alignment)
3. Carryover provision adds flexibility but requires tracking
4. Board certification alternative provides significant credit (50 vs. 40 required)

**For Physician Compliance:** Track 2-year renewal cycle, 3-year specialty topics (child/adult abuse), and 5-year specialty topics (opioid/end-of-life) separately. Use carryover strategically to balance heavy and light renewal cycles. Consider board certification as alternative compliance pathway (50-hour equivalent).

**For Rules Engine Implementation:** Primary challenge is tracking three overlapping cycles (2-year, 3-year, 5-year) and calculating variable specialty topic requirements at each renewal. Carryover logic requires tracking excess hours from previous cycle (max 20). Board certification alternative must credit 50 hours and potentially exempt specialty topics (clarification needed).

**Critical Next Steps:**
1. Contact Iowa Board of Medicine at (515) 281-5171 to clarify:
   - How 3-year and 5-year topic cycles align with 2-year renewal cycles
   - Board certification exemption scope (full or partial, specialty topics included?)
   - Renewal procedures, fees, and timeline
   - CME category requirements
   - Audit and documentation procedures
2. Review Iowa Administrative Code 653-13 for full regulatory details
3. Monitor IBOM website for any regulatory changes
