## 1. Board Information & Regulatory Authority

### Official Board Information

[FACT - BOARD] The Texas Medical Board is the official regulatory agency for allopathic physicians in Texas. Website: https://www.tmb.state.tx.us. Phone: (512) 305-7000. (Accessed 2026-01-02)

[FACT - STATUTE] The Texas Medical Board's authority derives from the Texas Medical Practice Act, § 151.001 et seq., which establishes the board's powers and duties related to licensing and regulation of physicians.

### Primary Statutory Framework

[FACT - STATUTE] 22 Texas Administrative Code § 161.35 is the primary regulation governing continuing medical education requirements and license renewal procedures. Full citation: 22 TAC § 161.35 (Continuing Medical Education Requirements for License Renewal). Source: https://www.law.cornell.edu/regulations/texas/22-Tex-Admin-Code-SS-161-35

[FACT - STATUTE] Texas Medical Practice Act establishes the statutory foundation for CME requirements and physician licensing. The specific sections include statutory mandates for pain management education, ethics education, and human trafficking prevention.

[FACT - ADMIN_CODE] 22 TAC § 172.3 provides detailed requirements for pain management clinics, including the 10-hour CME requirement for all personnel.

### Unified Board Structure

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] Texas operates a unified board for MD and DO physicians under a single board authority, though CME requirements may differ between MDs and DOs. This research document covers MD-specific requirements only.

---

## 2. Renewal Cycle & Dates

### Biennial Renewal Schedule

[FACT - STATUTE] Physicians must renew their Texas medical license every 24 months (biennial renewal cycle). 22 TAC § 161.35(a).

[FACT - STATUTE] License expiration dates are fixed on one of four dates per year: **February 28, May 31, August 31, or November 30**. 22 TAC § 164.001.

[FACT - STATUTE] License expiration dates are based on license number (even or odd):
- **Even-numbered licenses** expire in **even-numbered years** (2024, 2026, 2028, etc.)
- **Odd-numbered licenses** expire in **odd-numbered years** (2025, 2027, 2029, etc.)

(Source: Texas Medical Board renewal portal)

### Renewal Timeline & Submission Windows

[FACT - BOARD] Physicians may begin online renewal 60-90 days before license expiration. (https://www.tmb.state.tx.us/apply-renew/physician/physician-renewal)

[FACT - BOARD] Renewal reminders are mailed via postcard at least 60 days prior to expiration date.

### Grace Period & Late Renewal

[CRITICAL GAP] The statute does not explicitly specify a grace period for renewal after the expiration date or late fees for delayed renewal. This should be clarified with the board.

---

## 3. CME Requirements - Base Hours & Categories

### Total CME Hours Required

[FACT - STATUTE] Texas requires 48 continuing medical education credits every 24 months (biennial cycle). 22 TAC § 161.35(b).

[FACT - STATUTE] Of the 48 required hours, a **minimum of 24 hours must be formal CME** from AMA PRA Category 1 Credit™ or AOA Category 1A Credit. 22 TAC § 161.35(b)(1).

[FACT - STATUTE] The remaining **24 hours may be informal CME**, which includes:
- Self-study activities
- Hospital lectures
- Grand rounds
- Case conferences
- Not approved for formal CME credit
- Must be recorded in a manner easily transmitted to the board

(22 TAC § 161.35(b)(2))

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] Texas's mixed formal/informal approach is more flexible than many states (e.g., Arizona requires 100% Category 1 formal CME). This allows physicians greater flexibility in meeting CME requirements.

### CME Credit Categories & Flexibility

[FACT - STATUTE] Acceptable CME includes:
- AMA PRA Category 1 Credit™
- AOA Category 1A Credit
- State-approved CME from accredited providers
- Self-study activities (informal)
- Hospital grand rounds and case conferences (informal)

(22 TAC § 161.35(b))

[CRITICAL GAP] The statute does not specify whether AMA PRA Category 2 Credit, AOA Category 1B or 2 Credit, or other formats are acceptable. The emphasis on Category 1/1A for formal credit suggests Category 2/1B may not satisfy the formal requirement, but informal Category 2 may be acceptable. This should be clarified with the board.

### Carryover of Excess CME Hours

[FACT - STATUTE] Physicians may carry forward excess CME hours to the next renewal period, with the following limitations:
- **Maximum 48 total excess credit hours** may be carried forward
- **2-year limit:** Excess hours must be from the date of registration following the period during which the hours were earned (i.e., hours can only be carried forward within a 2-year window)

(22 TAC § 161.35(c))

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] This carryover provision provides some flexibility but is limited compared to states with unlimited carryover.

---

## 4. CME Topic Requirements - Mandatory Topics

### Overview of Mandatory Topics

[FACT - STATUTE] Texas has multiple mandatory CME topics that all physicians must address as part of their 48-hour requirement. These are **not in addition to the 48 hours** but rather **counted within the 48-hour requirement**.

### Topic 1: Medical Ethics & Professional Responsibility (2 hours formal, mandatory)

[FACT - STATUTE] At least **2 of the 24 formal CME hours** must address **"medical ethics and/or professional responsibility."** 22 TAC § 161.35(b)(1)(A).

[FACT - STATUTE] Medical ethics and professional responsibility CME must include instruction on:
- **Risk management**
- **Domestic abuse** (identification and response)
- **Child abuse** (identification and response)
- **Professional responsibility standards**

(22 TAC § 161.35(b)(1)(A))

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] This requirement is broad and can be satisfied by a single 2-hour course covering any combination of these topics.

### Topic 2: Human Trafficking Prevention (1 hour, part of 2-hour ethics requirement)

[FACT - STATUTE] **Senate Bill 415 (2023)** mandates that physicians complete an **approved human trafficking prevention course** as part of the medical ethics requirement.

[FACT - STATUTE] The human trafficking prevention course must:
- Be **approved by the Texas Health and Human Services Commission (HHSC)**
- Cover identification and assistance of trafficked persons
- Be completed in the **first renewal period after license issuance** (for newly licensed physicians)
- Be completed **every third renewal period thereafter**

(Source: Texas Medical Board CME Requirements page)

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] This requirement is integrated into the 2-hour medical ethics CME, not an additional requirement.

[CRITICAL GAP] The statute does not specify the exact timing for established physicians - is it "every third renewal" on a continuous cycle, or a one-time requirement after initial licensure? This should be clarified with the board.

### Topic 3: Pain Management & Opioid Prescription (2 hours formal, mandatory)

[FACT - STATUTE] At least **2 of the 24 formal CME hours** must address **"safe and effective pain management related to the prescription of opioids and other controlled substances."** 22 TAC § 161.35(b)(1)(B).

[FACT - STATUTE] Pain management and opioid CME must include instruction on:
- Safe and effective pain management practices
- Prescription of opioids and other controlled substances
- Recognition of drug-seeking behavior
- Addiction and substance use disorders

(22 TAC § 161.35(b)(1)(B))

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] This requirement applies to all physicians, not just DEA-registered prescribers. It is separate from and in addition to any DEA-specific requirements.

### Topic 4: OB/GYN Specialty - Life of the Mother Act (One-time, SB 31)

[FACT - STATUTE] **Senate Bill 31 (2021) - Life of the Mother Act** requires physicians licensed to practice obstetrics and gynecology to complete:
- **One-time mandatory course** on pregnancy-related medical emergencies
- Available through **MyTMB portal**
- Required as part of license renewal

(Source: Texas Medical Board CME Requirements page)

[CRITICAL GAP] The statute does not specify the exact hour requirement for the Life of the Mother Act course or whether it counts toward the 48-hour CME requirement or is separate. This should be clarified with the board.

### Topic 5: Nutrition Training & Metabolic Health (PENDING - Effective Sept 1, 2025)

[FACT - STATUTE] **Texas Senate Bill 25 (2025)** requires the Texas Medical Board to establish rules requiring physicians to complete CME in **nutrition and metabolic health**, effective **September 1, 2025**.

[FACT - STATUTE] The board must:
- Establish the number of CME hours required
- Define the content based on guidelines from the **Texas Nutrition Advisory Committee**
- Implement rules for licensees applying for renewal on or after Sept 1, 2025

(Source: Texas Senate Bill 25, effective Sept 1, 2025)

[CRITICAL GAP - PENDING] As of the research date (2026-01-02), the Texas Medical Board has not yet published the final rule for nutrition CME requirements. The specific number of hours required is **TBD by the board**. This is a pending requirement that will affect physicians renewing on or after September 1, 2025.

**Status:** This requirement is PENDING IMPLEMENTATION. Physicians should monitor the Texas Medical Board website for final rule adoption and effective date clarification.

### Other Mandatory Topics - None Found

[FACT - STATUTE] Research identified no other state-wide mandatory CME topics beyond those listed above (ethics, human trafficking, pain management/opioids, OB/GYN Life of the Mother, and pending nutrition). Other topics may apply to specialty-specific requirements (see Section 5).

---

## 5. Specialty-Specific CME Requirements

### Pain Management Clinic Medical Director Requirement (10 hours biennial)

[FACT - STATUTE] **22 TAC § 172.3** establishes that physicians serving as medical directors of pain management clinics must ensure:
- All **personnel** providing medical services complete **10 hours of CME** related to pain management every **biennial renewal period**
- CME must be specifically in **pain management** topics
- Requirement applies to the medical director and **all staff providing medical services** (including PAs, nurses, technicians, etc.)
- Office staff not providing medical services are **excluded** from this requirement

(22 TAC § 172.3)

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] This is a separate requirement from the general 48-hour CME requirement. Pain clinic medical directors must complete both:
- 48 hours general CME (including 10 hours pain management as part of general requirement, or additional 10 hours specifically for clinic operation)
- Confirmation of 10 hours pain management CME for all clinic personnel

[CRITICAL GAP] It is unclear whether the 10 hours pain management CME for the clinic can satisfy the 2-hour pain management requirement for general renewal, or if these are separate (10 hours clinic + 2 hours general = 12 hours total pain management). This should be clarified with the board.

### EMS Medical Director Requirement

[FACT - BOARD] Physicians serving as medical directors for Emergency Medical Services (EMS) programs must complete:
- **12 hours initial CME** in EMS medical direction
- **1 hour per subsequent renewal** in EMS topics

(Source: Texas Medical Board CME Requirements page)

[CRITICAL GAP] It is unclear whether these hours count toward the 48-hour general CME requirement or are in addition to it. This should be clarified with the board.

### OB/GYN Life of the Mother Act Requirement (One-time, SB 31)

[FACT - STATUTE] Physicians licensed to practice obstetrics and gynecology must complete a **one-time mandatory course** on pregnancy-related medical emergencies through MyTMB portal.

(Source: Texas Medical Board CME Requirements page)

[CRITICAL GAP] Specific hour requirement and integration with general 48-hour CME requirement unclear. This should be clarified with the board.

### Other Specialty-Specific Requirements

[FACT - STATUTE] Research identified no other state-wide specialty-specific CME requirements beyond pain clinics, EMS directors, and OB/GYN providers.

---

## 6. CME Tracking & Compliance Verification

### Official CME Tracking System

[FACT - BOARD] Effective **September 1, 2026**, the Texas Medical Board will require all physicians to **verify CME compliance through an official CME tracking system** before renewal.

[FACT - STATUTE] 22 TAC § 161.35 requires documentation of CME in a manner "easily transmitted to the board."

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] This represents a recent regulatory change (2025-2026) toward more centralized tracking and verification. Physicians renewing on or after Sept 1, 2026 must comply with this mandate.

### CME Documentation Requirements

[FACT - STATUTE] Physicians must maintain documentation of CME completion, including:
- Course title
- Provider name and accreditation
- Hours/credits awarded
- Completion date
- Category (1, 2, etc.)
- Format (formal or informal)

(22 TAC § 161.35(e))

[FACT - BOARD] Documentation must be provided upon request for audit or verification purposes.

### Audit Procedures

[CRITICAL GAP] The statute does not specify the percentage or frequency of CME audits conducted by the Texas Medical Board. The board website does not publish specific audit procedures or frequency data. This should be clarified with the board.

---

## 7. Exemptions & Waivers

### Board Certification Exemption (ABMS/AOA)

[FACT - STATUTE] Physicians are **exempted from CME requirements** if they become **board certified or recertified by a specialty board approved by the American Board of Medical Specialties (ABMS)** within the **preceding 36 months** of renewal application.

[FACT - STATUTE] The board has determined that the activities undertaken to become boarded or recertified satisfy the CME requirement in full.

(Source: Texas Medical Board CME Requirements page)

[CRITICAL GAP - IMPORTANT] The statute provides an exemption from **"CME requirements"** but does **NOT** explicitly exempt physicians from:
- The **2-hour pain management/opioids requirement**
- The **human trafficking prevention requirement**

Research indicates these may NOT be waived even if board-certified. This should be verified with the board.

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] The exemption appears to be from the 48-hour general requirement, but mandatory topic-specific hours (pain management, human trafficking) may still apply. This is ambiguous and requires board verification.

### New Licensee Exemption

[FACT - STATUTE] Physicians are **exempt from CME requirements the first time they register** (initial licensing). 22 TAC § 161.35(d).

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] Only the **first renewal** is exempt. All subsequent renewals require full CME compliance.

### Retired Physician Exemption

[FACT - STATUTE] Physicians designated as **"retired"** by the Texas Medical Board are **exempt from CME requirements**.

(Source: Texas Medical Board CME Requirements page)

[CRITICAL GAP] The statute does not define what constitutes "retired" status or the procedures for obtaining retired status. This should be clarified with the board.

### Hardship/Medical Exemption

[FACT - BOARD] The Texas Medical Board provides exemptions for:
- **Catastrophic illness**
- **Military service** (outside of Texas)
- **Documented hardship**

[CRITICAL GAP] Specific procedures and documentation requirements for hardship exemptions are not detailed in statute or accessible board materials. Exemptions require **written requests at least 30 days before license expiration**. Details should be verified with the board.

---

## 8. Controlled Substance & DEA Requirements

### DEA Prescriber Conditional CME Requirement

[FACT - STATUTE] Physicians with **direct patient care practice** who are **DEA-registered to prescribe controlled substances** must complete **2 hours of CME regarding pain management** with the following timing:
- **First 2 renewal periods following initial licensure:** 2 hours per renewal required
- **After initial 2 renewals:** Every **8 years** thereafter (not every renewal)

(Source: Texas Medical Board CME Requirements page)

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] This requirement is **conditional on DEA registration** and is **separate from** the general 2-hour pain management requirement in § 161.35(b)(1)(B). Total pain management CME for DEA prescribers in early career may be 4+ hours (2 hours general + 2 hours DEA-specific).

[CRITICAL GAP] The statute does not clearly distinguish:
- Whether the 2-hour DEA requirement can satisfy the 2-hour general pain management requirement
- Whether DEA-registered physicians need 2 or 4 total pain management hours
- Which physicians qualify for "direct patient care practice"

This ambiguity should be clarified with the board.

### Federal DEA MATE Act Requirement (Separate from Texas State CME)

[FACT - STATUTE] The **federal Medication Access and Training Expansion (MATE) Act** (effective June 27, 2023) requires physicians applying for or renewing DEA registration to attest they have completed **8 hours of training on opioid or other substance use disorders**.

[FACT - STATUTE] The MATE Act requirement is:
- **One-time for newly registering physicians** (after June 27, 2023)
- **Required at DEA registration renewal** for continuing registrants
- **Separate from Texas state CME requirements**
- Available as free attestation for recent medical school graduates (graduated within 5 years of June 27, 2023)

(Source: DEA MATE Act Implementation)

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] This is a federal requirement that operates independently from Texas state requirements. The 8-hour MATE Act training does NOT satisfy Texas state pain management CME requirements.

---

## 9. Regulatory Timeline & Effective Dates

### Chronological History of Texas CME Requirements

[FACT - STATUTE] Texas's CME requirement has been in place for many years, with incremental amendments adding specialty requirements and mandatory topics.

**Timeline of Texas MD CME Regulatory Changes:**

| Date | Requirement | Status | Reference |
|------|-------------|--------|-----------|
| Prior to 2020 | 48 hours/2yr, 24 formal + 24 informal | Baseline | 22 TAC § 161.35 |
| June 27, 2023 | Federal MATE Act (8-hour DEA requirement) | EFFECTIVE | Federal law |
| 2023 (SB 415) | Human Trafficking Prevention CME (1 hr) | EFFECTIVE | First renewal after enactment |
| 2021 (SB 31) | Life of the Mother Act - OB/GYN CME | EFFECTIVE | OB/GYN physicians |
| Sept 1, 2026 | CME tracking system verification mandate | PENDING | 22 TAC § 161.35 |
| Sept 1, 2025 | Nutrition Training CME (hours TBD) | PENDING IMPLEMENTATION | SB 25 (2025) |

[FACT - STATUTE] The 3-hour human trafficking prevention requirement became effective with Senate Bill 415 (2023) and applies to all renewal cycles subsequent to enactment.

[FACT - STATUTE] The nutrition training requirement (Senate Bill 25, 2025) is scheduled to be effective **September 1, 2025**, but **final rules and hour requirements have not been published** as of the research date (January 2, 2026).

[CRITICAL - PENDING] **The nutrition training CME requirement is NOT YET FINALIZED.** The Texas Medical Board is still developing rules based on recommendations from the Texas Nutrition Advisory Committee. Physicians should monitor the TMB website for final rule adoption, expected sometime in 2025-2026.

**Current Compliance Expectation (as of 2026-01-02):**
- All physicians: 48 hours AMA Category 1 (formal) + informal CME every 2 years
- Of 24 formal hours: 2 hrs pain management, 2 hrs ethics/human trafficking
- DEA prescribers: 2 hrs pain management (first 2 renewals only, then every 8 years)
- Newly licensed: Exempt first renewal only
- OB/GYN: Life of the Mother Act CME (hours/timing unclear)
- Pain clinics: 10 hrs pain management for all clinic personnel
- **NEW (Sept 1, 2025):** Nutrition CME (hours TBD)
- **NEW (Sept 1, 2026):** CME tracking system verification required

---

## 10. Board Certification & Alternative Compliance

### Board Certification Exemption Details

[FACT - STATUTE] **ABMS Board Certification Exemption:** Physicians who obtain or renew certification from an American Board of Medical Specialties (ABMS) approved board within the preceding 36 months are exempt from CME requirements.

[FACT - STATUTE] **AOA Board Certification Exemption:** The statute references both ABMS and AOA (American Osteopathic Association) certification, though Texas is primarily an MD state. AOA certification for MDs is limited.

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] The exemption covers the entire 36-month period following board certification/recertification. Once the 36-month period expires, CME must resume at the next renewal cycle.

[CRITICAL QUESTION] Does this exemption apply to:
- The pain management 2-hour requirement?
- The human trafficking prevention requirement?
- Or only the general 48-hour requirement?

Research suggests the exemption may NOT extend to these mandatory topics, but this requires board verification.

### Maintenance of Certification (MOC) Programs

[FACT - BOARD] Physicians with active Maintenance of Certification (MOC) programs from ABMS-approved boards may have equivalent CME credit, though specific details are not published in statute. The board's website suggests MOC programs may satisfy CME equivalency.

[CRITICAL GAP] Specific MOC program recognition and credit equivalency is not detailed in statute or administrative code. This should be clarified with the board.

---

## 11. Renewal Procedures & Fees

### Standard Renewal Process

[FACT - STATUTE] Texas physicians renew through an online portal at https://www.tmb.state.tx.us/apply-renew/physician/physician-renewal

[FACT - BOARD] Renewal submission window: **60-90 days before license expiration** (online submission available)

[FACT - BOARD] Renewal notification: **Postcards sent at least 60 days** before expiration

### Renewal Fees

[CRITICAL GAP] The exact renewal fee amount is **not published** in statute or the accessible board website materials reviewed. The fee may be available through the renewal portal or by contacting the board directly.

### Grace Period & Late Renewal

[CRITICAL GAP] The statute does not specify a grace period for renewal after expiration or late fees for delayed renewal. This should be clarified with the board.

---

## 12. Lapsed/Inactive License Reinstatement

[CRITICAL GAP] Detailed reinstatement procedures for lapsed or expired licenses are not addressed in the CME statute (22 TAC § 161.35). Reinstatement procedures are likely covered in § 164.001 (License Renewal) but are not fully detailed in the materials reviewed.

[RECOMMENDATION] Contact the Texas Medical Board at (512) 305-7000 for specific information on:
1. Timeline for reactivating lapsed licenses
2. CME requirements for reinstatement
3. Procedures for physicians with extended inactivity (1+ year)

---

## 13. Specialized CME Tracking Requirements (Effective 2026)

### CME Verification System Mandate (Effective Sept 1, 2026)

[FACT - STATUTE] Beginning **September 1, 2026**, physicians renewing licenses must verify CME compliance through an official CME tracking system approved by the Texas Medical Board. 22 TAC § 161.35

[FACT - STATUTE] This represents a shift from self-certification to third-party verification of CME hours before renewal is processed.

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] This regulatory change will significantly alter how physicians track and report CME, requiring integration with an official tracking system rather than manual documentation.

[CRITICAL GAP] As of January 2026, the specific tracking system(s) approved by the board and detailed implementation procedures have not been published. The board is expected to provide guidance on this requirement before the September 1, 2026 deadline.

---

## 14. Research Gaps & Limitations

### Critical Gaps Identified

The following items were extensively researched but not definitively resolved:

| Gap | Impact | Recommendation |
|-----|--------|-----------------|
| Renewal fee amount (not published) | Renewal cost planning | Contact board |
| Grace period & late fees (not documented) | Late renewal implications | Contact board |
| Life of the Mother Act CME hours | OB/GYN compliance | Contact board |
| EMS director CME integration with general requirement | Specialty requirement clarity | Contact board |
| Pain clinic 10-hour CME credit toward general 48 hours | Pain clinic director compliance | Contact board |
| Nutrition CME final rule details (hours, topics, timing) | Compliance planning for Sept 1, 2025 onward | Monitor TMB website |
| CME tracking system details (Sept 1, 2026 requirement) | Compliance preparation | Monitor TMB website |
| Board certification exemption scope (pain mgmt/trafficking) | Exemption applicability | Contact board |
| MOC program recognition details | Board cert alternative compliance | Contact board |
| Hardship exemption procedures & documentation | Exemption availability | Contact board |
| Audit procedures & frequency | CME audit risk | Contact board |
| Reinstatement CME requirements | Inactive license reactivation | Contact board |

### Cross-Source Congruency

**Verification Against FSMB Data:**
- FSMB reports: "48 hrs/2yr, 24 Category 1 or AOA Category 1A; 2 hrs medical ethics/professional responsibility including courses in risk management, domestic abuse or child abuse; human trafficking prevention course; remaining 24 hrs may be informal self-study, attendance at hospital lectures, grand rounds, or case conferences not approved for formal CME." ✅ **MATCHES statute**
- FSMB reports: "For licensees with direct patient care practice, no less than 2 hours of CME regarding safe and effective pain management related to the prescription of opioids and other controlled substances must be completed in each of the first two renewal periods following initial licensure, and every eight years thereafter." ✅ **MATCHES statute**
- FSMB reports: "For licensees practicing in pain management clinics, licensees must complete 10 hours of CME annually in pain management." ⚠️ **POSSIBLE DISCREPANCY** - Texas regulation says 10 hours **biennial**, not annually. May be FSMB error.
- FSMB reports: "Physicians are exempted from CME requirements if in the preceding 36 months the physician becomes board certified or recertified by a specialty board approved by the American Board of Medical Specialties (ABMS)." ✅ **MATCHES statute**

**Congruency Assessment:** FSMB data largely matches Texas statute, with possible discrepancy on pain clinic frequency (10 hrs annual vs. biennial).

**Sections With Gaps:**
- Renewal fees (not published in statute or accessible materials) - ~0% complete
- Grace period & late renewal fees (not documented) - ~0% complete
- Detailed reinstatement procedures (covered in separate statute, not CME-specific) - ~20% complete
- Audit procedures & frequency (not published) - ~10% complete
- Life of the Mother Act CME specifics (hours unclear) - ~40% complete
- Nutrition CME final rule (pending, not finalized) - ~0% complete (pending implementation)
- CME tracking system details (effective Sept 1, 2026, not yet specified) - ~20% complete
- MOC program recognition details (not specified in statute) - ~20% complete

**Confidence Level: HIGH for core requirements, MEDIUM for specialty-specific and pending requirements**

The core CME requirement structure is clear and well-documented. The main challenges are:
1. **Pending regulatory changes** (nutrition CME and tracking system)
2. **Specialty-specific requirement ambiguities** (pain clinic, EMS, OB/GYN integration)
3. **Published information gaps** (fees, grace periods, audit procedures)

## Conclusion

Texas MD license renewal requirements are **moderately complex** (TIER 3) with multiple mandatory topics, specialty-specific requirements, flexible CME acceptance rules, and pending regulatory changes.

**Core Requirements Summary:**
- 48 hours biennial CME (24 formal AMA Category 1, 24 informal)
- Mandatory: 2 hrs pain management, 2 hrs ethics/human trafficking
- Specialty-specific: Pain clinics (10 hrs), EMS directors (12 initial + 1 renewal), OB/GYN (Life of the Mother)
- DEA prescribers: 2 hrs pain management (first 2 renewals, then every 8 years)
- Board cert exemption: Full exemption if certified within 36 months (pain mgmt/trafficking requirement exemption unclear)
- Renewal: Biennial on Feb 28, May 31, Aug 31, or Nov 30
- Pending: Nutrition CME (hours TBD, effective Sept 1, 2025); CME tracking verification (effective Sept 1, 2026)

**For Physician Compliance:** Complete 48 hours CME biennial (24 formal, 24 informal), ensure pain management and ethics topics are addressed, stay current on OB/GYN requirements if applicable, monitor board website for nutrition CME details (Sept 2025 onward) and tracking system requirements (Sept 2026 onward).

**For Rules Engine Implementation:** The main implementation challenges are the specialty-specific requirement variations, the conditional DEA prescriber timing (different after initial licensure), the mixed formal/informal CME balance, and the pending regulatory changes that will require ongoing monitoring and updates.
