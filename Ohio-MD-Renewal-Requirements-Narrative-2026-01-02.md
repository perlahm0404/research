## 1. Board Information & Regulatory Authority

### Official Board Information

[FACT - BOARD] The State Medical Board of Ohio is the official regulatory agency for physicians in Ohio. Website: https://www.med.ohio.gov. Phone: (614) 466-3934. (Standard research date: 2026-01-02)

[FACT - STATUTE] The State Medical Board of Ohio's authority derives from Ohio Revised Code § 4731 et seq., which establishes the board's powers and duties related to licensing and regulation of physicians.

### Primary Statutory Framework

[FACT - STATUTE] Ohio Revised Code § 4731.281 is the primary statute governing continuing medical education requirements for physicians. This section establishes the 50-hour CME requirement per biennial cycle.

[FACT - ADMIN_CODE] Ohio Administrative Code 4731-11-01 provides detailed requirements for continuing medical education, including category requirements and mandatory topics.

[FACT - BOARD] Renewal portal: https://elicense.ohio.gov (Ohio eLicense system)

### Unified Board Structure

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] Ohio operates a unified board for MD and DO physicians under a single board authority, though CME requirements may have differences. This research document covers MD-specific requirements only.

---

## 2. Renewal Cycle & Dates

### Biennial Renewal Schedule

[FACT - STATUTE] Ohio physicians renew their medical licenses every 24 months (biennial renewal cycle). ORC § 4731.22.

[FACT - STATUTE] License renewal is based on the physician's **initial registration date**, creating individual renewal dates throughout the year rather than a fixed statewide date or birth month.

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] Registration date-based renewal distributes renewal processing throughout the year and ties renewal to the anniversary of initial licensure.

### Renewal Timeline & Submission Windows

[FACT - BOARD] Physicians may renew online through the Ohio eLicense system approximately **60-90 days prior** to the expiration date.

[CRITICAL GAP] Specific grace period and late fee information is not documented in readily accessible board materials. This should be clarified with the board.

---

## 3. CME Requirements - Base Hours & Categories

### Total CME Hours Required

[FACT - STATUTE] Ohio requires **50 continuing medical education hours every 2 years (biennial cycle)**. ORC § 4731.281.

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] At 50 hours biennial, Ohio aligns with many states' standard biennial CME requirements, making it neither particularly high nor low.

### Category Requirements - All Category 1 Required

[FACT - STATUTE] All 50 hours must be **AMA PRA Category 1 Credit** (formal CME from ACCME-accredited providers). ORC § 4731.281 and OAC 4731-11-01.

[FACT - STATUTE] Ohio does **NOT accept AMA PRA Category 2 Credit** or other informal self-study activities for CME compliance.

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] Ohio's all-Category-1 requirement is more restrictive than states that allow mixed Category 1/Category 2 credits (like Texas with 24/24 split or New Hampshire with 40/60 split). This limits flexibility but ensures all CME is formal, accredited education.

### CME Categories & Formats

[FACT - STATUTE] Acceptable CME must be:
- **AMA PRA Category 1 Credit** from ACCME-accredited providers
- Live conferences, enduring materials with post-testing, online courses with evaluation
- State medical association-approved programs
- Specialty society programs with AMA Category 1 designation

(OAC 4731-11-01)

[CRITICAL GAP] The statute does not specify whether AOA Category 1-A/1-B credit is acceptable for MD physicians in Ohio, or if it's restricted to DO physicians. This should be clarified with the board.

### Carryover of Excess CME Hours

[CRITICAL GAP] Research did not identify explicit carryover provisions in accessible statute or board materials. Whether excess CME hours can be carried forward to the next renewal period is unclear and should be verified with the board.

---

## 4. CME Topic Requirements - Mandatory Topics

### Overview of Mandatory Topics

[FACT - STATUTE] Ohio has one primary mandatory CME topic that all physicians must address as part of their 50-hour requirement. This is **counted within the 50 hours**, not in addition.

### Topic 1: Licensee Duty to Report (1 hour, mandatory for all physicians)

[FACT - STATUTE] All physicians must complete **1 hour of continuing education on the licensee's duty to report** during each biennial renewal period. ORC § 4731.83.

[FACT - STATUTE] The duty to report CME must address:
- Legal obligations to report impaired or incompetent physicians
- Reporting mechanisms and procedures
- Immunity protections for good-faith reporting
- Professional responsibility to patient safety

(OAC 4731-11-01)

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] This requirement applies to all physicians regardless of practice setting or specialty, making it a universal mandatory topic for Ohio licensees.

[CRITICAL GAP] The statute does not clarify whether the 1 hour duty to report must be taken as a standalone course or can be embedded within other ethics or professionalism CME. Best practice would assume a dedicated 1-hour course until confirmed otherwise.

### Other Mandatory Topics - None for General Physicians

[FACT - RESEARCH] Research identified no other state-wide mandatory CME topics for general physicians beyond duty to report. Ohio does not appear to have general mandatory requirements for:
- Pain management or opioid prescribing (applies only to pain clinic operators - see Section 5)
- Ethics or professionalism (beyond duty to report)
- Human trafficking
- Implicit bias
- Cultural competency

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] The absence of additional mandatory topics for general physicians makes Ohio relatively straightforward compared to states with multiple topic-specific requirements.

---

## 5. Specialty-Specific CME Requirements

### Pain Management Clinic Medical Director Requirement (20 hours biennial)

[FACT - STATUTE] **Ohio Revised Code § 4731.85-4731.87** establishes that physicians who own or serve as medical directors of pain management clinics must complete **20 hours of continuing medical education in pain medicine** every **biennial renewal period**. ORC § 4731.85.

[FACT - STATUTE] Pain management clinic CME must include:
- **Pain medicine Category 1 credit**
- **Addiction medicine courses** (as part of the 20 hours)
- Topics addressing safe opioid prescribing, multimodal pain management, addiction recognition and treatment

(OAC 4731-11-01)

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] This is a separate requirement from the general 50-hour CME requirement. Pain clinic medical directors must complete:
- 50 hours general CME (including 1 hour duty to report) + 20 hours pain medicine-specific = **70 hours total biennial**

OR (more likely based on statute language):
- 50 hours general CME including 20 hours pain medicine within the 50, plus ensuring addiction courses are included

[CRITICAL GAP] It is unclear whether the 20 hours pain medicine CME must be:
- **In addition to** the 50-hour general requirement (70 hours total)
- **Included within** the 50-hour general requirement (20 of 50 must be pain medicine)

This distinction significantly affects compliance burden and should be clarified with the board.

[FACT - STATUTE] Pain management clinics are defined as facilities where the majority of patients are treated for chronic pain with controlled substances. ORC § 4731.85.

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] This requirement applies only to physicians operating or directing pain clinics, not to all physicians who prescribe opioids or treat pain patients. The scope is narrow and specialty-specific.

### Other Specialty-Specific Requirements

[FACT - RESEARCH] Research identified no other state-wide specialty-specific CME requirements beyond pain clinic medical directors.

---

## 6. Exemptions & Special Circumstances

### Board Certification Exemption

[CRITICAL GAP] Research did not identify explicit board certification exemptions (ABMS, AOA, RCPSC) in accessible statute or board materials. Unlike some states that provide CME exemptions or credit for board certification or Maintenance of Certification (MOC) programs, Ohio does not appear to have such provisions documented.

[INFERENCE - LOW CONFIDENCE] The absence of documented board certification exemptions suggests Ohio may not provide this alternative, but verification with the board is needed.

### First-Time Renewal Provisions

[CRITICAL GAP] Research did not identify explicit first-time renewal exemptions or reduced requirements for newly licensed physicians in accessible statute or board materials. Whether newly licensed physicians have grace periods or reduced CME requirements for their first renewal should be verified with the board.

### Retired or Inactive Physicians

[CRITICAL GAP] Exemptions for retired or inactive physician status are not documented in readily accessible materials. Physicians seeking retired status should contact the board directly.

---

## 7. CME Tracking & Compliance Verification

### CME Documentation Requirements

[FACT - STATUTE] Physicians must maintain documentation of CME completion and provide certificates upon request for audit or verification. OAC 4731-11-01.

[FACT - BOARD] Ohio physicians attest to CME compliance at renewal through the eLicense portal.

[CRITICAL GAP] Specific documentation retention requirements (e.g., 2 years, 4 years, 6 years) are not detailed in readily accessible statute or board materials.

### Verification at Renewal

[FACT - BOARD] The Ohio eLicense system requires attestation of CME compliance at renewal. Physicians must certify they have completed required CME hours.

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] Ohio uses an attestation-based system at renewal with potential post-renewal audits, rather than requiring certificate upload at the time of renewal.

### Audit Procedures

[FACT - STATUTE] The State Medical Board of Ohio may audit CME compliance and request documentation at any time. OAC 4731-11-01.

[CRITICAL GAP] The percentage or frequency of audits is not published in readily accessible statute or board materials. Whether audits are random, for-cause, or stratified by specialty is unclear.

---

## 8. Renewal Procedures & Fees

### Standard Renewal Process

[FACT - BOARD] Physicians renew through the Ohio eLicense system at https://elicense.ohio.gov

[FACT - BOARD] Renewal submission window: **60-90 days before license expiration** (based on registration date anniversary).

### Renewal Fees

[CRITICAL GAP] The specific renewal fee amount is not published in readily accessible statute or board materials reviewed. This should be obtained from the board directly or through the eLicense portal.

### Grace Period & Late Renewal

[CRITICAL GAP] Grace period mechanics and late fees are not documented in readily accessible statute or board materials. This should be clarified with the board.

## 9. Research Gaps & Limitations

### Critical Gaps Identified

| Gap | Impact | Recommendation |
|-----|--------|-----------------|
| Pain clinic 20-hr CME integration (in addition to 50 hrs or within 50 hrs) | Pain clinic medical director total hour calculation | Contact board - CRITICAL |
| Renewal fees (not published in accessible materials) | Renewal cost planning | Contact board or check eLicense portal |
| Grace period & late fees (not documented) | Late renewal implications | Contact board |
| Board certification exemption (not found in statute) | Alternative compliance options | Contact board |
| Audit procedures & frequency (not published) | Audit compliance risk | Contact board |
| First-time renewal provisions (not found) | Newly licensed physician requirements | Contact board |
| Carryover policy (not documented) | Excess CME credit planning | Contact board |
| Documentation retention period (not specified) | Record-keeping compliance | Contact board |
| AOA credit acceptance for MD physicians (not clarified) | CME category planning | Contact board |
| Duty to report course format (standalone vs embedded) | Topic compliance | Contact board |

### Cross-Source Congruency

**Verification Against FSMB Data:**
- FSMB reports: "50 hrs/2yr, all Category 1" ✅ **MATCHES statute**
- FSMB reports: "1 hr licensee duty to report" ✅ **MATCHES statute**
- FSMB reports: "Pain management clinic owners: 20 hrs/2yr pain medicine Category 1 (including addiction courses)" ✅ **MATCHES statute** (integration question remains)

**Congruency Assessment:** FSMB data aligns with Ohio statute based on available information. No significant conflicts identified, but the 20-hour pain clinic requirement integration (in addition vs within) needs clarification.

## Conclusion

Ohio MD license renewal requirements are **straightforward** (TIER 1) with an all-Category-1 requirement (50 hours), one universal mandatory topic (1 hr duty to report), and one specialty-specific requirement for pain clinic medical directors (20 hrs pain medicine).

**Core Requirements Summary:**
- 50 hours biennial CME, all hours must be AMA PRA Category 1 (no Category 2 accepted)
- Mandatory topic: Duty to report (1 hour) - applies to all physicians
- Specialty-specific: Pain clinic medical directors - 20 hours pain medicine Category 1 (integration with general 50 hours unclear)
- Renewal: Biennial based on registration date (individual dates)
- No documented board certification exemption
- No documented carryover policy

**For Physician Compliance:** Complete 50 hours AMA Category 1 CME biennial, ensure 1 hour duty to report is included. Pain clinic medical directors must verify with board whether 20 hours pain medicine is in addition to or within the 50-hour requirement. Maintain CME documentation for potential audit.

**For Rules Engine Implementation:** The main implementation challenges are the registration date-based renewal timing (requires individual tracking per physician), the pain clinic 20-hour requirement integration ambiguity (in addition vs within 50 hours - CRITICAL to resolve), and the all-Category-1 restriction (no Category 2 allowed). The mandatory 1-hour duty to report topic is straightforward to implement.
