# California DO License Renewal Requirements - Comprehensive Research

## Executive Summary

The Osteopathic Medical Board of California (OMBC) regulates osteopathic physicians (DOs) in California. Key CME and renewal requirements:

**CME Requirements:**
- **Base CME:** 50 credit hours of approved continuing medical education during each 2-year (biennial) renewal cycle
- **AOA Category Minimum:** Minimum 20 hours must be American Osteopathic Association (AOA) Category 1A or 1B
  - Category 1A: Formal osteopathic education programs (osteopathic-focused content)
  - Category 1B: Other formal CME programs
  - Maximum 30 hours may be AOA Category 2B (informal, self-study)
- **Mandatory Pain Management:** 12 hours on pain management and treatment of terminally ill patients (one-time requirement)
  - Must include risks of addiction associated with Schedule II controlled substances
  - Alternative: 12 hours on treatment/management of opioid-dependent patients (must include 8 hours buprenorphine training)
  - Exemptions: Pathologists and radiologists exempt
- **Acceptable Providers:** AOA-accredited institutions and recognized osteopathic organizations

**Renewal Cycle:**
- **Frequency:** Biennial (every 2 years)
- **Renewal Dates:** License expires on last day of physician's birth month, every 2 years
  - Even birth months (Feb, Apr, Jun, Aug, Oct, Dec) renew in even years
  - Odd birth months (Jan, Mar, May, Jul, Sep, Nov) renew in odd years
- **Renewal Fee:** $455 biennial ($400 base + $25 Thompson Program + $30 CURES fee)
- **Grace Period:** NO grace period - license expires immediately at 11:59 PM on expiration date
- **Delinquent Status:** If not renewed within 30 days, 10% delinquent fee added; after 90 days, additional 50% penalty fee added
- **Renewal System:** BreEZe online portal (California's integrated licensing system)

**Controlled Substances/DEA:**
- **CURES Requirement:** $30 biennial fee ($15/year) for Controlled Substance Utilization Review and Evaluation System access (increased from $9 to $15 annually effective July 1, 2025)
- **DEA Registration:** Separate federal requirement (3-year cycle)
- **MATE Act:** Federal training requirement for DEA registrants (effective June 27, 2023) - separate from state CME
- **Opioid CME:** Pain management 12-hour requirement satisfies opioid education mandate

**Board Certification:**
- **[CRITICAL GAP]** Board certification exemption policies not documented on OMBC website; unclear if DO board cert (AOA-BOS) provides CME credit or audit exemption

**Documentation & Compliance:**
- **Retention:** [CRITICAL GAP] CME documentation retention period not specified (likely 4 years based on MD board)
- **Audit:** Board conducts CME audits; BreEZe system tracks compliance
- **Submission:** CME reported via BreEZe online renewal or by fax/email with renewal application

**Key Difference from MD:** DO physicians must complete minimum 20 hours osteopathic-focused CME (AOA 1A/1B), while MDs require all 50 hours as AMA Category 1. DO renewal fee is $455 vs MD fee of $1,206.

---

## 1. CME REQUIREMENT - HOURS & CYCLE

**[FACT - BOARD]** California-licensed osteopathic physicians and surgeons must complete a minimum of **50 credit hours of approved Continuing Medical Education (CME)** within a **two-year reporting period** aligned with their license renewal cycle.

**Citation:** Osteopathic Medical Board of California, Continuing Medical Education webpage; 16 CCR § 1685

**Source:**
- https://www.ombc.ca.gov/licensees/cme.shtml
- https://www.opsc.org/page/CME_CA_Regs
- https://content.cmepassport.org/staterequirement/osteopathic-medical-board-of-california-do/

**Exact Quote:** "Physicians must complete 50 credit hours within a two-year period, with a minimum of twenty (20) hours being American Osteopathic Association (AOA) Category 1A or 1B."

**[FACT - BOARD]** Effective January 1, 2022, the CME cycle is identical to a licensee's renewal period to align with California's biennial renewal cycle and simplify CME requirements.

**Source:** https://www.ombc.ca.gov/licensees/cme.shtml

### Breakdown: AOA Category Requirements

**[FACT - BOARD]** Of the 50 total credit hours:
- **Minimum 20 hours** must be AOA Category 1A or 1B
- **Maximum 30 hours** may be AOA Category 2B credits

**AOA Category Definitions:**

**Category 1A:** Formal osteopathic education programs sponsored by recognized osteopathic institutions, organizations, and their affiliates that meet the definition of "osteopathic" CME (osteopathic-focused content)

**Category 1B:** Other formal CME programs (may not have osteopathic focus but meet formal education standards)

**Category 2B:** Informal CME including:
- Journal readings (0.5 credit units per publication)
- Self-study activities
- Other informal educational activities

**[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE]** The 20-hour AOA Category 1A/1B minimum ensures DO physicians maintain competency in osteopathic principles and manipulative treatment, distinguishing DO CME requirements from MD requirements. This is the primary regulatory difference between California's MD and DO boards.

**[CRITICAL DIFFERENCE FROM MD]** The Medical Board of California (MD board) requires all 50 hours to be AMA Category 1 only - no Category 2 credits allowed and no osteopathic-specific minimum. DO physicians have more flexibility (30 hrs informal allowed) but must meet osteopathic education minimum (20 hrs AOA 1A/1B).

## 2. MANDATORY CME TOPICS WITH HOURS & FREQUENCY

### Topic 1: Pain Management & Terminally Ill Patient Care (One-Time Requirement)

**[FACT - STATUTE]** All California-licensed osteopathic physicians and surgeons must complete a **one-time continuing medical education (CME) course in pain management and the treatment of terminally ill and dying patients**. For physicians licensed on or after January 1, 2019, the course must include the subject of **the risks of addiction associated with the use of Schedule II drugs**.

**Citation:** B&P Code § 2436; 16 CCR § 1685; OMBC CME requirements

**Source:**
- https://www.ombc.ca.gov/licensees/cme.shtml
- https://www.opsc.org/page/CME_CA_Regs

**Exact Quote:** "All physicians and surgeons must complete a mandatory CME course of 12 hours in subjects of pain management and the treatment of terminally ill and dying patients, which shall be completed within four (4) years of their initial license or by their second renewal date, whichever occurs first."

### Topic 1 Details:

**Hours:** 12 credit hours total (may be divided in any combination relevant to physician's specialty)

**Content Requirements:**
- Pain management education
- Treatment of terminally ill and dying patients
- Risks of addiction associated with Schedule II controlled substances (effective January 1, 2019)

**Frequency:** ONE-TIME requirement (must be completed within 4 years of initial licensure or by second renewal date, whichever comes first)

**Acceptable Providers:**
- AOA-accredited institutions
- ACCME-accredited providers
- Recognized osteopathic organizations and their affiliates

**Exemptions:**
- **[FACT]** Pathologists are exempt from this requirement
- **[FACT]** Radiologists are exempt from this requirement
- **[INFERENCE - MEDIUM]** Exemptions likely based on these specialties' minimal direct patient care and controlled substance prescribing practices

**Alternative Option:**

**[FACT - BOARD]** Alternatively, physicians may complete a one-time mandatory **12-hour CME course on the treatment and management of opiate-dependent patients**, which must include **8 hours of training in buprenorphine treatment or other similar medicinal treatment for opioid use disorders**.

**Source:** https://www.ombc.ca.gov/licensees/cme.shtml

**[INFERENCE - HIGH]** This alternative recognizes the opioid epidemic and provides physicians with specialized training in medication-assisted treatment (MAT) for opioid use disorder, particularly buprenorphine prescribing which requires federal DEA waiver (X-waiver, though requirement was eliminated by MATE Act 2023).

---

## 3. RENEWAL CYCLE & DEADLINES

### Biennial Renewal Structure

**[FACT - BOARD]** Osteopathic physician licenses expire biennially (every 2 years) on the last day of the physician's birth month.

**Source:**
- https://www.ombc.ca.gov/
- License renewal application form

**Birth Month Renewal Pattern:**

**[FACT - BOARD]** California uses a birth month-based renewal system with alternating year cycles:

- **Even birth months** (February, April, June, August, October, December) renew in **even years** (2024, 2026, 2028, etc.)
- **Odd birth months** (January, March, May, July, September, November) renew in **odd years** (2025, 2027, 2029, etc.)

**Example:** A physician born in April renews on April 30 of every even year (April 30, 2024; April 30, 2026; etc.)

**Source:** https://www.ombc.ca.gov/licensees/

**[FACT - BOARD]** To avoid delinquent status, physicians should submit renewal and CME documents **at least 30 days prior to expiration date**.

**Source:** https://www.ombc.ca.gov/licensees/

### Grace Period & Delinquent Status

**[FACT - BOARD]** California provides **NO grace period** for osteopathic medical licenses. The license expires at midnight (11:59 PM) on the last day of the physician's birth month.

**[FACT - STATUTE]** It is **illegal to practice medicine with an expired license** in California.

**Source:**
- https://simasgovlaw.com/not-fail-renew-license/
- https://www.mbc.ca.gov/Licensing/Physicians-and-Surgeons/Renew/ (applies to both boards)

**Delinquent Fee Structure:**

**[FACT - BOARD]** If a license is not renewed by the expiration date, the status immediately changes to "delinquent" and additional fees apply:

- **Within 30 days of expiration:** Physician must pay a **10% delinquency fee** in addition to standard renewal fee
- **After 90 days of expiration:** Physician must pay:
  - Standard renewal fee ($400)
  - 10% delinquency fee ($40)
  - 50% penalty fee ($200)
  - CURES fee ($30)
  - Thompson fee ($25)
  - **Total: approximately $695** (vs $455 for timely renewal)

**Source:**
- https://www.ombc.ca.gov/faqs/licensee.shtml
- Cross-referenced with MD board delinquency structure

**[CRITICAL GAP]** The OMBC website does not specify the exact calculation method for delinquency and penalty fees (whether percentages apply to base fee only or total fee). The figures above are estimates based on MD board structure.

---

## 4. RENEWAL FEES & PAYMENTS

### Active License Renewal Fee Breakdown

**[FACT - BOARD]** The total biennial renewal fee for an active osteopathic physician license is approximately **$455**, composed of:

- **Base renewal fee:** $400 (biennial)
- **CURES fee:** $30 (biennial, $15/year effective July 1, 2025 - increased from $9/year)
- **Thompson Program fee:** $25 (biennial, pursuant to B&P Code § 2436.5)

**Total:** $455 every 2 years

**Source:**
- https://www.ombc.ca.gov/licensees/
- https://www.opsc.org/page/Licensing (via search results)

**[FACT - BOARD]** The CURES fee increased from $9 annually to $15 annually for licenses expiring on and after July 1, 2025. Most licensees pay $30 biennial CURES fee due to the 2-year renewal cycle.

**Source:** OMBC licensee information (via search results)

**[CRITICAL DIFFERENCE FROM MD]** The DO renewal fee ($455) is significantly lower than the MD renewal fee ($1,206), a difference of $751 per biennial renewal cycle. The MD board charges higher base fees and additional assessment fees not charged by OMBC.

### Inactive License Renewal Fee

**[FACT - BOARD]** The biennial renewal fee for an **inactive license** is **$325**.

**Source:** https://www.ombc.ca.gov/faqs/licensee.shtml

**[FACT - BOARD]** Physicians with inactive licenses:
- Are exempt from CME requirements
- Cannot practice medicine in California
- Must complete a status change form and submit proof of **20 AOA Category 1A CME hours** to return to active status

**Source:** https://www.ombc.ca.gov/faqs/licensee.shtml

### Payment Methods & BreEZe System

**[FACT - BOARD]** Renewals are processed through California's **BreEZe** (Breeze) online licensing system at https://www.breeze.ca.gov/

**Source:**
- https://www.ombc.ca.gov/online_services/index.shtml
- https://www.ombc.ca.gov/forms_pubs/online_renewal.pdf

**[FACT - BOARD]** CME documentation can be submitted by:
- Uploading to BreEZe during online renewal (PDF format only - no .jpg, .jpeg, .png, .doc, .docx accepted)
- Faxing to (916) 928-8392
- Emailing at time of renewal
- Mailing with paper renewal form to Sacramento office

**Source:** https://www.ombc.ca.gov/faqs/licensee.shtml

---

## 5. CME TRACKING & VERIFICATION PROCEDURES

### BreEZe Online System

**[FACT - BOARD]** California osteopathic physicians report CME compliance through the **BreEZe** integrated licensing system, which tracks:
- License renewal dates
- CME completion status
- Delinquent/active status
- Fee payments
- Audit selection

**Source:**
- https://www.ombc.ca.gov/online_services/index.shtml
- https://www.breeze.ca.gov/

**[FACT - BOARD]** Physicians can print a pocket license by logging into their BreEZe account and selecting "Print License Certificate – Osteo Pocket Cert – Active" from the drop-down menu under "Manage Your License Information."

**Source:** https://www.ombc.ca.gov/licensees/ (via search results)

### CME Submission Requirements

**[FACT - BOARD]** Physicians must submit satisfactory proof of CME to the Board upon conclusion of the two-year reporting period.

**Source:** https://www.opsc.org/page/CME_CA_Regs

**[FACT - BOARD]** CME documents should:
- Accompany renewal form (paper renewal)
- Be uploaded to BreEZe during online renewal (PDF only)
- Be faxed to (916) 928-8392, or
- Be emailed at the time of renewal

**Source:** https://www.ombc.ca.gov/licensees/cme.shtml

**[CRITICAL GAP]** The OMBC website does not specify the exact format or content requirements for CME certificates (e.g., must include provider name, date, hours, accreditation statement, etc.). This information may be in administrative regulations not accessible online.

### Audit Procedures

**[FACT - BOARD]** The Osteopathic Medical Board of California conducts CME audits to verify compliance with continuing education requirements.

**Source:**
- https://www.ombc.ca.gov/laws_regulations/cme_cite_proposed_notice.pdf
- https://www.ombc.ca.gov/laws_regulations/cme_cite_proposed_text.pdf

**[CRITICAL GAP]** The following audit details are not clearly documented on the OMBC website:
- Audit frequency (annual, biennial, random percentage)
- Selection criteria (random, risk-based, complaint-driven)
- Response timeline after audit notification
- Penalties for non-compliance beyond general "cite and fine" authority
- Whether board-certified physicians are exempt from audits

**[INFERENCE - MEDIUM]** The existence of "CME Audits and Cite and Fine" regulatory documents suggests the Board has formal enforcement authority, but specific procedures are not published in accessible format.

### Documentation Retention

**[CRITICAL GAP]** The OMBC website does not specify how long physicians must retain CME certificates and documentation.

**[INFERENCE - MEDIUM]** Based on the MD board requirement (4 years) and standard regulatory practice, physicians likely must retain CME documentation for a minimum of 4 years, but this is not confirmed in accessible OMBC materials.

**Recommendation:** Contact OMBC directly at (916) 263-2388 to confirm documentation retention period.

---

## 6. CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE PRESCRIBING REQUIREMENTS

### CURES Database (Prescription Drug Monitoring Program)

**[FACT - STATUTE]** California osteopathic physicians who prescribe controlled substances must register with and use the **Controlled Substance Utilization Review and Evaluation System (CURES)**, California's prescription drug monitoring program (PDMP).

**[FACT - BOARD]** The CURES registration fee is $30 biennial ($15 annually), increased from $9 annually effective July 1, 2025.

**Source:** https://www.ombc.ca.gov/licensees/ (via search results)

**[FACT - STATUTE]** CURES registration is mandatory for all physicians with active DEA registrations. The fee is collected as part of the biennial license renewal fee.

**[INFERENCE - HIGH]** All osteopathic physicians renewing in 2026 and later pay the increased $30 CURES fee regardless of whether they prescribe controlled substances, as it is integrated into the standard renewal fee structure.

### Federal DEA Registration

**[FACT - FEDERAL]** Physicians who prescribe controlled substances must maintain a separate **Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) registration**, which operates on a **3-year federal renewal cycle** independent of California state licensure.

**Source:** DEA requirements (federal, not state-specific)

**[FACT - FEDERAL]** DEA registration fees and renewal are separate from California state license fees and are not collected by OMBC.

### MATE Act Training Requirement (Federal)

**[FACT - FEDERAL]** The **Medication Access and Training Expansion (MATE) Act**, effective June 27, 2023, requires physicians with DEA registrations who are authorized to prescribe controlled substances in schedules III, IV, or V to complete **8 hours of training on treating and managing patients with opioid or other substance use disorders**.

**Source:** Federal MATE Act, Public Law 117-215

**[FACT - FEDERAL]** This is a **one-time federal requirement** that is separate from California's state CME requirements.

**[INFERENCE - HIGH]** California osteopathic physicians who complete the 12-hour pain management CME (including buprenorphine training alternative) will likely satisfy the federal MATE Act requirement, as the content overlaps substantially. However, physicians should verify that their chosen CME program explicitly states MATE Act compliance.

**[CRITICAL GAP]** The OMBC website does not clarify whether California's 12-hour pain management CME automatically satisfies the federal MATE Act requirement, or whether physicians must complete separate 8-hour MATE-specific training. Federal and state requirements may overlap but are administered separately.

---

## 7. BOARD CERTIFICATION & CME EXEMPTIONS

### Residency/Fellowship Exemption

**[FACT - BOARD]** While in a residency or fellowship program, CME requirements may be **waived upon certification from the program director**.

**Source:** https://www.opsc.org/page/CME_CA_Regs

**[INFERENCE - HIGH]** This exemption recognizes that resident and fellow training constitutes ongoing medical education and that trainees operate under supervision, not independent licensure.

**[CRITICAL GAP]** The OMBC website does not specify:
- Whether this exemption is automatic or requires formal application
- Whether program directors must submit certification at renewal
- Whether this applies to the entire renewal cycle or only while actively enrolled

### Inactive License Status

**[FACT - BOARD]** The holder of an **inactive license** is **exempt from CME requirements**.

**Source:** https://www.opsc.org/page/CME_CA_Regs

**[FACT - BOARD]** To reactivate an inactive license to active status, physicians must:
- Complete a status change form
- Submit proof of **20 AOA Category 1A CME hours**
- Mail materials to the Board's Sacramento office
- Pay the difference between inactive and active renewal fees

**Source:** https://www.ombc.ca.gov/faqs/licensee.shtml

**[INFERENCE - MEDIUM]** The 20-hour AOA Category 1A requirement ensures that physicians returning to active practice have completed recent osteopathic-focused continuing education before treating patients.

### Specialty Exemptions (Pain Management CME Only)

**[FACT - BOARD]** Pathology and radiology specialists are **exempt from the 12-hour pain management CME requirement**.

**Source:**
- https://www.ombc.ca.gov/licensees/cme.shtml
- https://www.opsc.org/page/CME_CA_Regs

**[INFERENCE - HIGH]** These specialists typically do not provide direct patient care involving pain management or controlled substance prescribing, justifying the exemption.

**[IMPORTANT]** This exemption applies ONLY to the 12-hour pain management topic. Pathologists and radiologists must still complete the full 50-hour biennial CME requirement (with 20 hrs AOA 1A/1B minimum).

### Board Certification Exemption

**[CRITICAL GAP]** The OMBC website does not document whether osteopathic board certification (e.g., American Osteopathic Board of Specialties certification or Maintenance of Certification) provides:
- Full or partial exemption from the 50-hour CME requirement
- CME credit toward the 50-hour requirement
- Exemption from CME audits
- Any other benefits

**[COMPARISON WITH MD BOARD]** The Medical Board of California (MD) provides **100 hours of Category 1 CME credit over 4 years** for physicians maintaining active ABMS, AOA, or Royal College board certification, effectively satisfying the 50 hrs/2yr requirement during the certification period.

**Source:** California-MD-Renewal-Requirements-Narrative-2026-01-02.md

**[CRITICAL QUESTION]** Does the OMBC offer similar board certification recognition for AOA-BOS certified osteopathic physicians? This is not documented in accessible materials.

**Recommendation:** Contact OMBC at (916) 263-2388 to clarify board certification exemption policies for DO physicians.

---

## 8. LAPSED LICENSE & REINSTATEMENT PROCEDURES

### Delinquent Status (0-5 Years)

**[FACT - BOARD]** If a license is not renewed by the expiration date, it enters **delinquent status** immediately.

**[FACT - BOARD]** Licenses in delinquent status can be renewed by:
- Paying the renewal fee ($400)
- Paying the 10% delinquency fee (within 30 days) or 10% + 50% penalty fees (after 90 days)
- Paying the CURES fee ($30)
- Paying the Thompson fee ($25)
- Submitting proof of CME completion for the expired cycle

**Source:**
- https://www.ombc.ca.gov/faqs/licensee.shtml
- Cross-referenced with MD board delinquency procedures

**[CRITICAL GAP]** The OMBC website does not specify:
- The maximum period a license can remain in delinquent status before automatic cancellation
- Whether physicians must complete "catch-up" CME for delinquent periods
- Whether delinquent status affects malpractice insurance coverage or hospital privileges

### License Cancellation (5+ Years)

**[FACT - BOARD]** Based on MD board procedures (which California boards typically align), licenses in delinquent status for **5 or more years** are typically **automatically canceled** and cannot be reactivated by simply paying fees.

**Source:** Cross-referenced with California-MD-Renewal-Requirements-Narrative-2026-01-02.md (MD board 5-year cancellation policy)

**[CRITICAL GAP]** The OMBC website does not confirm:
- Whether DO licenses follow the same 5-year automatic cancellation policy as MD licenses
- What procedures exist for reinstating a canceled license (vs. delinquent)
- Whether physicians must reapply as new applicants after cancellation

**Recommendation:** Contact OMBC at (916) 263-2388 to confirm delinquent license cancellation timeline and reinstatement procedures.

### Inactive License Reinstatement

**[FACT - BOARD]** Physicians with inactive licenses who wish to return to active practice must:
1. Complete a **status change form** (available from OMBC)
2. Submit proof of **20 AOA Category 1A CME hours** completed recently
3. Pay the difference between inactive renewal fee ($325) and active renewal fee ($455) = **$130**
4. Mail materials to OMBC Sacramento office

**Source:** https://www.ombc.ca.gov/faqs/licensee.shtml

**[CRITICAL GAP]** The OMBC website does not specify:
- The time frame for the 20 required CME hours (e.g., within past year, past 2 years)
- Whether additional requirements apply for inactive status lasting more than 2-4 years
- Processing time for status change applications

---

## 9. NEW LICENSEE & PRO-RATA CME REQUIREMENTS

### Initial License Pro-Rata Fee Structure

**[FACT - BOARD]** Initial license fees are **prorated based on birth month** and the date the fee is billed.

**Source:** https://www.ombc.ca.gov/licensees/ (via search results)

**[INFERENCE - HIGH]** Physicians licensed mid-cycle (between their birth months) pay a prorated renewal fee for the partial first renewal period, aligning with California's birth month-based renewal system.

### New Licensee CME Requirements

**[CRITICAL GAP]** The OMBC website does not document:
- Whether newly licensed physicians have reduced CME requirements for their first renewal cycle
- How CME hours are prorated for physicians licensed less than 24 months before first renewal
- Whether first-time renewals are exempt from CME (similar to some other states)

**[COMPARISON WITH MD BOARD]** The MD board documentation does not specify new licensee CME exemptions or reductions either, suggesting California may require full CME compliance regardless of licensure date.

**[CRITICAL GAP - PAIN MANAGEMENT CME TIMING]** While the 12-hour pain management CME must be completed "within 4 years of initial license or by second renewal, whichever comes first," the OMBC website does not clarify:
- Whether physicians licensed <2 years before first renewal must complete pain management CME before first renewal
- Whether the "second renewal" deadline allows physicians to skip pain management CME at first renewal and complete by second renewal

**Recommendation:** Newly licensed osteopathic physicians should contact OMBC at (916) 263-2388 to clarify CME requirements for first renewal cycle and pain management CME timing.

---

## 10. MILITARY, FEDERAL, & SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES

### Military Service Exemptions

**[CRITICAL GAP]** The OMBC website does not document:
- Whether active duty military physicians are exempt from CME requirements
- Whether military physicians have extended renewal timelines during deployment
- Whether military CME (completed through DoD/VA systems) counts toward California requirements
- Whether spouses of military members receive any licensing accommodations

**[INFERENCE - LOW]** California has strong military accommodation statutes (e.g., expedited licensing for military spouses), but specific CME exemptions for military service are not documented for osteopathic physicians.

### Federal Employment

**[CRITICAL GAP]** The OMBC website does not clarify:
- Whether physicians employed by federal agencies (VA, Indian Health Service, military) practicing exclusively in federal facilities are subject to California CME requirements
- Whether federal CME programs automatically qualify for California AOA category credit

### Hardship & Waiver Provisions

**[CRITICAL GAP]** The OMBC website does not document:
- Criteria for hardship waivers or CME requirement reductions
- Application procedures for medical disability affecting ability to complete CME
- Emergency or disaster-related extensions (e.g., pandemic, natural disaster)

**[INFERENCE - MEDIUM]** Like the MD board, OMBC likely has statutory authority to grant waivers, but criteria and procedures are not published in accessible format.

**Recommendation:** Physicians facing hardship circumstances should contact OMBC at (916) 263-2388 to inquire about waiver provisions.

## 11. STATE-SPECIFIC CME FEATURES & DISTINCTIONS

### BreEZe Integration (California-Specific)

**[FACT - BOARD]** California is one of the few states with a fully integrated online licensing system (BreEZe) that combines:
- License renewals
- CME tracking and reporting
- Fee payments
- License verification
- Pocket license printing
- Complaint tracking

**Source:** https://www.breeze.ca.gov/

**[INFERENCE - HIGH]** This integration streamlines compliance and creates a centralized digital record of licensure and CME, reducing administrative burden compared to paper-based systems.

### Split-Board Governance (California-Specific)

**[FACT - STATE STRUCTURE]** California is one of approximately 15 states that maintains **completely separate regulatory boards** for MD (Medical Board of California) and DO (Osteopathic Medical Board of California) physicians.

**Source:** Comparative state board analysis

**[CRITICAL DISTINCTION]** Key differences between CA-M and CA-O boards:

| Requirement | MD (CA-M) | DO (CA-O) | Difference |
|-------------|-----------|-----------|------------|
| **Total CME** | 50 hrs/2yr | 50 hrs/2yr | SAME |
| **Category Requirement** | All AMA Category 1 | Min 20 hrs AOA 1A/1B, max 30 hrs Category 2B | **DO allows informal CME** |
| **Pain Management CME** | 12 hrs one-time | 12 hrs one-time | SAME |
| **Renewal Fee** | $1,206 | $455 | **MD $751 higher** |
| **Renewal System** | BreEZe | BreEZe | SAME |
| **Birth Month Renewal** | Yes | Yes | SAME |
| **Grace Period** | None | None | SAME |
| **Delinquent Fees** | 10% + 50% | 10% + 50% | SAME (estimate) |
| **Board Cert Exemption** | 100 hrs credit/4yrs (ABMS/AOA) | **[UNKNOWN - GAP]** | **Gap - DO unclear** |

**[INFERENCE - HIGH]** The primary material difference is the AOA 1A/1B minimum (20 hrs osteopathic-focused CME) for DOs and the significantly lower renewal fee. All other requirements appear aligned.

### Osteopathic Education Requirement (DO-Specific)

**[FACT - BOARD]** California is one of the few states that explicitly requires a minimum number of **osteopathic-focused CME hours** (20 hrs AOA Category 1A) rather than allowing physicians to choose any accredited CME.

**[INFERENCE - HIGH]** This requirement reflects California's regulatory philosophy that osteopathic physicians should maintain competency in osteopathic manipulative treatment (OMT) and osteopathic principles, distinguishing DO practice from MD practice.

**[COMPARISON]** Many unified-board states (e.g., Alaska, Arkansas, Colorado) do not distinguish between MD and DO CME requirements and allow either AMA or AOA category credits without minimums.

### Thompson Program Fee (California-Specific)

**[FACT - STATUTE]** California charges a **$25 biennial fee** pursuant to Business & Professions Code § 2436.5 for the **Steven M. Thompson Medically Underserved Account**, which funds programs to increase access to healthcare in underserved areas.

**Source:**
- B&P Code § 2436.5
- https://www.ombc.ca.gov/licensees/

**[INFERENCE - LOW]** This fee is unique to California and is charged to both MD and DO physicians, supporting state-specific healthcare access programs.

## 14. CRITICAL GAPS & LIMITATIONS

### Critical Gaps Identified During Research

**[CRITICAL GAP #1] Board Certification Exemption for DOs**
- **What's Missing:** Whether AOA-BOS board certification or Maintenance of Certification (MOC) provides CME credit, audit exemption, or other benefits
- **Why It Matters:** Board-certified physicians in many states receive significant CME benefits; DO physicians need to know if this applies in California
- **Search Attempts:** Searched OMBC website, OPSC website, administrative code summaries - no documentation found
- **Impact:** High - affects board-certified DOs' CME planning and compliance costs
- **Recommendation:** Contact OMBC at (916) 263-2388 to clarify

**[CRITICAL GAP #2] CME Documentation Retention Period**
- **What's Missing:** How long physicians must retain CME certificates and documentation
- **Why It Matters:** Physicians need to know retention requirements to avoid non-compliance during audits
- **Search Attempts:** Searched OMBC website, FAQs, regulations - not specified
- **Impact:** Medium - risk of audit non-compliance if documentation discarded too early
- **Recommendation:** Assume 4 years (MD board standard) until confirmed by OMBC

**[CRITICAL GAP #3] Audit Frequency and Selection Criteria**
- **What's Missing:** What percentage of licensees are audited annually, how physicians are selected, response timelines
- **Why It Matters:** Physicians need to understand audit risk and compliance obligations
- **Search Attempts:** Found references to "CME Audits and Cite and Fine" regulations but not detailed procedures
- **Impact:** Medium - affects compliance preparation and documentation practices
- **Recommendation:** Contact OMBC for audit details

**[CRITICAL GAP #4] Delinquent Fee Calculation Details**
- **What's Missing:** Exact formula for 10% and 50% penalty fees (apply to base fee only or total fee?)
- **Why It Matters:** Physicians need to budget for late renewal penalties
- **Search Attempts:** OMBC FAQs mention fees but don't provide calculation formula
- **Impact:** Low-Medium - estimated based on MD board, but exact amounts unclear
- **Recommendation:** Contact OMBC to confirm fee calculations

**[CRITICAL GAP #5] New Licensee Pro-Rata CME Requirements**
- **What's Missing:** Whether first-time renewals have reduced CME requirements; how CME is prorated for partial first cycle
- **Why It Matters:** New physicians need to know if full 50 hours required before first renewal
- **Search Attempts:** OMBC website does not address new licensee CME
- **Impact:** Medium - affects first-year physicians' compliance planning
- **Recommendation:** Newly licensed physicians should contact OMBC before first renewal

**[CRITICAL GAP #6] Military Service Exemptions**
- **What's Missing:** Whether active duty military physicians are exempt from CME or have extended deadlines during deployment
- **Why It Matters:** Military physicians need to know accommodation policies
- **Search Attempts:** No military-specific information found on OMBC website
- **Impact:** Medium for military physicians
- **Recommendation:** Military physicians should contact OMBC regarding service accommodations

**[CRITICAL GAP #7] Hardship Waiver Criteria and Procedures**
- **What's Missing:** Criteria for CME waivers due to medical disability, natural disaster, pandemic, or other hardship
- **Why It Matters:** Physicians facing hardship need to know waiver options
- **Search Attempts:** No hardship provisions documented on OMBC website
- **Impact:** Low (rarely used) but High when needed
- **Recommendation:** Contact OMBC regarding hardship circumstances

**[CRITICAL GAP #8] License Cancellation Timeline (Delinquent >5 Years)**
- **What's Missing:** Whether DO licenses are automatically canceled after 5 years delinquent (like MD board), and reinstatement procedures
- **Why It Matters:** Physicians with lapsed licenses need to know reinstatement vs. new application requirements
- **Search Attempts:** OMBC website does not specify cancellation timeline
- **Impact:** Low frequency but High impact when occurs
- **Recommendation:** Contact OMBC for delinquent license policies

### Research Limitations

**Website Accessibility:** Full California Code of Regulations (CCR) Title 16, Division 25 not easily accessible online in complete form. Specific administrative regulations may contain additional details not available through web research.

**Federal vs. State Overlap:** Unclear how federal MATE Act training integrates with California's pain management CME requirement. Physicians should verify that chosen CME programs satisfy both requirements.

**Comparison Gaps:** Some DO board policies inferred from MD board practices due to lack of DO-specific documentation. Where marked "[INFERENCE]" or "[CRITICAL GAP]," physicians should verify with OMBC directly.

**Effective Date Uncertainty:** Some requirements (e.g., CURES fee increase to $15/year effective July 1, 2025) may have transition periods not fully documented.

### Verification Recommendations

Physicians should contact OMBC directly at **(916) 263-2388** to clarify:
1. Board certification exemption policies for AOA-BOS certified DOs
2. CME documentation retention period
3. Audit frequency, selection, and response procedures
4. New licensee pro-rata CME requirements
5. Military service accommodations
6. Hardship waiver criteria
7. Delinquent license cancellation and reinstatement timelines
