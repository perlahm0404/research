# Oklahoma License Renewal Requirements - NP (Nurse Practitioners)

## Comprehensive Research Document

**Research Date:** January 1, 2026  
**License Type:** NP (Nurse Practitioners) - Advanced Practice Registered Nurses  
**Board:** Oklahoma Board of Nursing (NOT the Medical Board)  
**Research Protocol:** State Medical License Renewal Requirements Research Framework v2.1

---

## CRITICAL FINDING: SEPARATE REGULATORY AUTHORITY

### Important Distinction

**Nurse Practitioners in Oklahoma are NOT regulated by the State Board of Medical Licensure and Supervision** (unlike MDs and DOs).

Instead, **NPs are regulated by the Oklahoma Board of Nursing** - a completely separate state licensing board with different statutes, rules, and renewal procedures.

This research document provides what information was found about NP renewal requirements, but with significant gaps due to the different regulatory framework.

## Executive Summary

Oklahoma Nurse Practitioners (NPs), also known as Advanced Practice Registered Nurses (APRNs), are licensed and regulated by the **Oklahoma Board of Nursing**, not the medical board. This means:

- Different governing statutes (Title 59 - Professions and Occupations, but under nursing provisions)
- - Different renewal procedures
  - - Different continuing education requirements
    - - Different fees and penalties
      - - Different application and disclosure requirements
       
        - ### Known NP Requirements (Limited Information)

            ## Section B: RESEARCH LIMITATIONS - CRITICAL GAPS

            ### Why This Document Has Limited Information

            This research protocol was designed to research **medical license renewal requirements** (MDs, DOs, and to verify if NPs were included). During the research phase, it became evident that:

            1. **NPs Are Regulated Separately:** Oklahoma's Board of Nursing (not the Medical Board) regulates NPs
            2. 2. **Different Statutes Apply:** NP renewal requirements are in different sections of Title 59 than MD/DO requirements
               3. 3. **Outside Initial Scope:** The initial research focused on the Medical Board statutes; NP-specific nursing board rules were not accessed
                 
                  4. ### Major Research Gaps for NP Renewal Requirements

                                    7. 7. **Continuing Education Providers** - Approved CME/CEU providers for NPs
                                       8. 8. **Board Contact Information** - Phone, address, renewal portal
