## 1. Board Information & Regulatory Authority

### Official Board Information

[FACT - BOARD] The Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), Division of Public Health, Licensure Unit is the official regulatory agency for physicians in Nebraska. Website: https://dhhs.ne.gov/licensure/Pages/Physician.aspx. Phone: (402) 471-2115. (Accessed 2026-01-02)

[FACT - STATUTE] The Nebraska DHHS Licensure Unit's authority derives from the Nebraska Revised Statutes Chapter 38, Article 2 (Medicine and Surgery Practice Act) and the Uniform Credentialing Act.

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] Nebraska operates a unified medical board regulating both MD and DO physicians under the same statutory framework and CME requirements.

### Primary Statutory Framework

[FACT - STATUTE] Nebraska Revised Statutes § 38-178 establishes the statutory requirement for continuing competency, which is implemented through continuing medical education requirements. Source: Neb. Rev. Stat. § 38-178.

[FACT - ADMIN_CODE] 172 Nebraska Administrative Code Chapter 88 provides the detailed regulatory framework for continuing medical education requirements, including the 50-hour biennial requirement, carryover provisions, and mandatory topics. Source: 172 NAC 88.

[FACT - BOARD] Renewal portal: https://www.nebraska.gov/online-services/health-and-human-services/physicians-and-surgeons/

---

## 2. Renewal Cycle & Dates

### Biennial Renewal Schedule (Every 2 Years)

[FACT - STATUTE] Nebraska physicians renew their medical licenses every 2 years (biennial cycle). 172 NAC 88.

[CRITICAL GAP] The specific renewal deadline dates (birth month, fixed date, etc.) are not documented in the accessible materials reviewed. Physicians should verify their individual renewal date through the DHHS licensure portal or by contacting the board directly.

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] Based on common state practices, Nebraska likely uses either a birth month renewal system or a fixed renewal date system. Individual physicians should confirm their renewal date.

### Renewal Timeline & Submission Windows

[CRITICAL GAP] Renewal submission window timeline (e.g., 60 days prior to expiration, 90 days prior) is not documented in accessible materials. Contact DHHS Licensure Unit for specific renewal window information.

[CRITICAL GAP] Grace period mechanics and late renewal procedures are not documented in accessible statute or administrative code materials reviewed.

---

## 3. CME Requirements - Base Hours & Categories

### Total CME Hours Required

[FACT - STATUTE] Nebraska requires **50 continuing medical education hours every 2 years (biennial renewal cycle)**. All 50 hours must be AMA Category 1 or AOA equivalent. 172 NAC 88.

[FACT - FSMB] FSMB State CME Requirements document confirms: "50 hrs/2yr, all Category 1." This matches the statutory requirement.

### Category Requirements

[FACT - STATUTE] All 50 hours must be **AMA Category 1 or AOA Category 1-A equivalent**. Nebraska does not accept AMA Category 2 or other informal CME for the base requirement. 172 NAC 88.

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] The Category 1-only requirement means physicians must complete formal, accredited CME activities. Self-study, journal reading, or other informal activities (typically Category 2) do not count toward the 50-hour requirement.

### Carryover Provision (Up to 25 Hours)

[FACT - STATUTE] Nebraska permits physicians to **carry over up to 25 hours from the previous two-year period** to the current renewal period. 172 NAC 88.

[FACT - FSMB] FSMB confirms: "Carryover: up to 25 hrs from two-year period."

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] The carryover provision provides flexibility for physicians who complete more than 50 hours in one cycle. Excess hours (up to 25) can be applied to the next cycle, reducing the requirement for the following period.

**Example:**
- Cycle 1 (2024-2025): Physician completes 70 hours → 50 hours satisfy Cycle 1 requirement, 20 hours carried forward to Cycle 2
- Cycle 2 (2026-2027): Physician needs 50 hours total, but with 20-hour carryover credit, only needs to complete 30 new hours

[CRITICAL GAP] The mechanics of claiming carryover hours (automatic vs. physician attestation) are not documented in accessible materials.

### Recognition of AMA PRA and AOA CME Certification

[FACT - STATUTE] The Nebraska board **recognizes the AMA Physician's Recognition Award (PRA) or AOA CME Certification** as evidence of meeting CME requirements. 172 NAC 88.

[FACT - FSMB] FSMB confirms: "Board recognizes Physician's Recognition Award or AOA CME Certification."

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] Physicians who maintain current AMA PRA or AOA CME Certification status may be able to satisfy the Nebraska CME requirement by providing proof of current certification, rather than submitting individual course certificates.

[CRITICAL GAP] Whether PRA/AOA certification provides a complete exemption from the 50-hour requirement or simply serves as documentation of compliance is not explicitly stated in accessible materials.

---

## 4. CME Topic Requirements - Mandatory Topics

### Overview of Mandatory Topics

[FACT - STATUTE] Nebraska has one primary mandatory CME topic: **3 hours of opioid prescribing education biennial**, which must include **0.5 hours of PDMP (Prescription Drug Monitoring Program) training**. 172 NAC 88 and Nebraska Opioid Prevention Act (LB 923, 2018).

[FACT - FSMB] FSMB confirms: "Opioid prescribing: 3 hrs biennial (including 0.5 hrs PDMP)."

### Topic 1: Opioid Prescribing (3 hours biennial, including 0.5 hours PDMP, MANDATORY)

[FACT - STATUTE] All physicians must complete **3 hours of continuing education on opioid prescribing** every 2 years (biennial). This requirement includes **0.5 hours specifically on the Nebraska PDMP**. Nebraska Opioid Prevention Act (LB 923, 2018).

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] The 3-hour opioid prescribing requirement is integrated into the 50-hour biennial total (not in addition to the 50 hours). Physicians complete 3 hours of opioid CME plus 47 hours of other Category 1 CME to reach the 50-hour total.

**Opioid CME Content Areas (Likely):**
- Safe opioid prescribing practices
- Opioid risk assessment and screening
- Prescription Drug Monitoring Program (PDMP) use and interpretation (0.5 hours required)
- Recognition of opioid use disorder and addiction
- Alternative pain management strategies
- CDC opioid prescribing guidelines

[CRITICAL GAP] Specific acceptable courses, providers, or content standards for the 3-hour opioid requirement are not detailed in accessible materials. Physicians should verify acceptable courses with DHHS or review ACCME-accredited opioid CME offerings.

[CRITICAL GAP] Whether the opioid requirement applies to ALL physicians or only those with DEA registration/controlled substance prescribing authority is not explicitly stated. Based on the statute language, it appears to apply to all physicians, but confirmation with the board is recommended.

### PDMP Training Component (0.5 hours within the 3-hour opioid requirement)

[FACT - STATUTE] Within the 3-hour opioid prescribing requirement, **0.5 hours must be specifically dedicated to the Nebraska Prescription Drug Monitoring Program (PDMP)**. Nebraska Opioid Prevention Act (LB 923, 2018).

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] The PDMP training likely covers:
- How to access and use the Nebraska PDMP system
- Interpretation of PDMP reports
- Integration of PDMP checks into clinical workflow
- Regulatory requirements for PDMP consultation

[CRITICAL GAP] Whether the 0.5-hour PDMP component must be a standalone course or can be integrated within a 3-hour opioid CME course is not specified.

---

## 5. Exemptions & Alternatives

### AMA Physician's Recognition Award (PRA) and AOA CME Certification

[FACT - STATUTE] The Nebraska board recognizes the **AMA Physician's Recognition Award (PRA)** or **AOA CME Certification** as evidence of CME compliance. 172 NAC 88.

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] Physicians who maintain current AMA PRA or AOA CME Certification may satisfy the Nebraska CME requirement by submitting proof of current certification. This likely provides an alternative to submitting individual course certificates.

[CRITICAL GAP] The scope of the PRA/AOA exemption is unclear:
- Does it provide a **complete exemption** from the 50-hour requirement?
- Does it satisfy the **50-hour requirement** but physicians must still complete the 3-hour opioid requirement separately?
- Does it serve as **documentation** of compliance with the 50-hour requirement, but the physician must still complete all required hours including opioid training?

**Recommendation:** Contact DHHS Licensure Unit at (402) 471-2115 to clarify whether PRA/AOA certification exempts physicians from the 50-hour requirement, the 3-hour opioid requirement, or both.

### Board Certification (ABMS/AOA)

[CRITICAL GAP] Whether ABMS board certification or ABMS Maintenance of Certification (MOC) provides any exemption or credit toward the Nebraska CME requirement is not documented in accessible materials.

[INFERENCE - LOW CONFIDENCE] Unlike some states (e.g., Texas, Idaho) that provide explicit CME exemptions for board-certified physicians, Nebraska does not appear to offer a board certification exemption. However, board certification activities may count toward the 50-hour Category 1 requirement if they are ACCME-accredited.

### Newly Licensed Physicians

[CRITICAL GAP] Whether newly licensed physicians (first-time renewals) receive any exemption, reduction, or pro-rated CME requirement is not documented in accessible materials.

### Military Service & Hardship Exemptions

[CRITICAL GAP] Military service exemptions, hardship exemptions, or other special circumstances (illness, disability, etc.) are not documented in accessible materials.

---

## 6. Audit & Verification Procedures

### CME Documentation Requirements

[FACT - STATUTE] Physicians must maintain documentation of CME completion for audit and verification purposes. 172 NAC 88.

[CRITICAL GAP] The specific documentation retention period (e.g., 4 years, 6 years, duration of licensure) is not documented in accessible materials.

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] Physicians should retain CME certificates, transcripts, or other proof of completion for at least the duration of the current renewal cycle plus one additional cycle (approximately 4 years) to ensure availability in case of audit.

### Audit Procedures

[FACT - STATUTE] The Nebraska DHHS Licensure Unit conducts random audits of physicians for CME compliance. 172 NAC 88.

[CRITICAL GAP] The percentage or frequency of audits (e.g., 5% of renewals annually, 10% of renewals) is not published in statute or accessible materials.

[CRITICAL GAP] Audit response timeline (e.g., 30 days to provide documentation, 60 days) is not documented.

[CRITICAL GAP] Consequences of audit non-compliance (fines, license suspension, additional CME requirements) are not detailed in accessible materials.

---

## 7. Renewal Procedures & Fees

### Standard Renewal Process

[FACT - BOARD] Physicians renew through the Nebraska online portal at: https://www.nebraska.gov/online-services/health-and-human-services/physicians-and-surgeons/

[CRITICAL GAP] Renewal submission window (when renewal opens prior to expiration) is not documented in accessible materials.

### Renewal Fees

[CRITICAL GAP] The specific renewal fee amount is not published in accessible materials reviewed. Physicians should check the renewal portal or contact DHHS for current fee information.

### Grace Period & Late Renewal

[CRITICAL GAP] Grace period mechanics (if any), late renewal procedures, and late fees are not documented in statute or accessible materials.

---

## 8. Lapsed License Reinstatement

### Reinstatement Procedures

[CRITICAL GAP] Lapsed license reinstatement procedures, timelines, and CME requirements for reinstatement are not documented in the materials reviewed.

[INFERENCE - LOW CONFIDENCE] Nebraska likely has tiered reinstatement procedures based on length of lapse (e.g., <1 year, 1-3 years, >3 years), similar to other TIER 1 states, but specific requirements are not documented.

---

## 9. Controlled Substance Context

### Opioid Prescribing CME (3 hours biennial)

[FACT - STATUTE] As detailed in Section 4, all physicians must complete 3 hours of opioid prescribing education biennial, including 0.5 hours on the Nebraska PDMP. Nebraska Opioid Prevention Act (LB 923, 2018).

### DEA Registration Requirements

[CRITICAL GAP] Whether the opioid CME requirement applies only to physicians with DEA registration or to all physicians is not explicitly stated in accessible materials.

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] Based on the statute language and common state practices, the opioid requirement likely applies to all physicians, not just those with DEA registration. However, confirmation with the board is recommended.

### PDMP Training (0.5 hours within opioid requirement)

[FACT - STATUTE] 0.5 hours of the 3-hour opioid requirement must focus on the Nebraska Prescription Drug Monitoring Program (PDMP). Nebraska Opioid Prevention Act (LB 923, 2018).

---

## 10. CME Tracking Systems

### CME Tracking & Documentation

[CRITICAL GAP] Whether Nebraska uses a centralized CME tracking system (e.g., CE Broker) or relies on physician attestation and audit is not documented in accessible materials.

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] Based on common TIER 1 state practices, Nebraska likely uses a physician attestation system where physicians certify CME completion during renewal, with documentation verified only upon audit.

### CME Provider Auto-Reporting

[CRITICAL GAP] Whether CME providers are required to auto-report completion to the Nebraska board is not documented.

---

## Conclusion

Nebraska MD license renewal requirements are **straightforward and simple** (TIER 1) with a standard biennial CME requirement, minimal mandatory topics, and a helpful carryover provision.

**Core Requirements Summary:**
- 50 hours biennial CME, all AMA Category 1 or AOA equivalent
- 3 hours opioid prescribing biennial (includes 0.5 hours PDMP training)
- Carryover provision: up to 25 hours from prior period
- Recognition of AMA PRA or AOA CME Certification
- Biennial renewal cycle (specific dates not documented)
- Random audits conducted

**Key Simplicity Factors:**
1. Single biennial CME requirement (50 hours)
2. All Category 1 (clear, no mixed category complexity)
3. Minimal mandatory topics (only 3 hours opioid)
4. Carryover provision provides flexibility
5. Recognition of AMA PRA/AOA certification simplifies documentation for some physicians

**For Physician Compliance:** Complete 50 hours of AMA Category 1 CME every 2 years, ensuring 3 hours focus on opioid prescribing (including 0.5 hours on Nebraska PDMP). Excess hours (up to 25) can be carried forward to the next cycle. Physicians with AMA PRA or AOA CME Certification should verify whether certification satisfies the requirement.

**For Rules Engine Implementation:** The primary implementation challenge is clarifying the scope of PRA/AOA certification recognition and opioid CME applicability. The carryover provision requires tracking excess hours from prior periods. Renewal date mechanics and fee information need to be obtained from the board for complete implementation.
