The Louisiana State Board of Medical Examiners regulates allopathic physicians in Louisiana. Key requirements for renewal:

- **CME Requirement:** 20 hours per year, all AMA PRA Category 1
- **Renewal Cycle:** Annual (every year)
- **One-Time Requirements:** Drug diversion course (CDS license holders), board orientation (new licensees)
- **Pending Requirement:** Nutrition and metabolic health (1 hr every 2 years for family medicine, internal medicine, pediatrics, OB/GYN - effective June 20, 2025)
- **Renewal Deadline:** [To be verified - likely December 31 or birth month-based]
- **Board Certification:** [Exemption status to be verified]
- **Audit Rate:** [To be verified]

---

## 1. Board Information & Regulatory Authority

### Official Board Information

[FACT - BOARD] The Louisiana State Board of Medical Examiners (LSBME) is the official regulatory agency for allopathic physicians in Louisiana. Website: https://www.lsbme.la.gov/. Phone: (504) 568-6820. (Accessed 2026-01-02)

[FACT - STATUTE] The Louisiana State Board of Medical Examiners' authority derives from Louisiana Revised Statutes Title 37, Chapter 15 (Louisiana Medical Practice Act).

### Primary Statutory Framework

[FACT - STATUTE] Louisiana Revised Statutes Title 37, Chapter 15 establishes the statutory foundation for medical licensure and continuing education in Louisiana.

[FACT - ADMIN_CODE] Louisiana Administrative Code Title 46, Part XLIII provides detailed regulations for medical licensing and CME requirements.

[FACT - BOARD] Louisiana operates a unified board structure for MD and DO physicians (Louisiana State Board of Medical Examiners regulates both).

---

## 2. Renewal Cycle & Dates

### Annual Renewal Schedule

[FACT - STATUTE] Louisiana physicians renew their medical licenses annually (every year).

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] Annual renewal is less common than biennial (2-year) renewal in most states. Louisiana's annual cycle provides more frequent touchpoints for compliance verification but requires annual fee payment and renewal submission.

[CRITICAL GAP] Specific renewal deadline dates (e.g., December 31, birth month, license issue date) are not documented in available materials.

**Common Annual Renewal Patterns:**
- Fixed date (e.g., December 31 for all physicians)
- Birth month-based (staggered throughout year)
- License issue anniversary date

[RECOMMENDATION] Contact the Louisiana State Board of Medical Examiners to clarify annual renewal deadline structure.

### Renewal Timeline & Submission Windows

[CRITICAL GAP] The exact timeline for when physicians may begin renewal before expiration, notification procedures, and submission windows are not documented in available research materials.

### Grace Period & Late Renewal

[CRITICAL GAP] Grace period mechanics, late fees, and consequences of missed annual renewal deadlines are not documented in available materials.

---

## 3. CME Requirements - Base Hours & Categories

### Total CME Hours Required

[FACT - STATUTE] Louisiana requires 20 hours of continuing medical education annually (every year).

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] The annual 20-hour requirement equates to 40 hours over 2 years, which is comparable to many biennial states (e.g., Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Iowa, Mississippi all require 40 hours per 2 years).

**Comparison to Biennial States:**
- Louisiana: 20 hours/year = 40 hours/2 years = 60 hours/3 years
- Typical biennial: 40-50 hours/2 years
- Louisiana's requirement is moderate and standard when compared on a biennial basis

### Category 1 Requirement

[FACT - STATUTE] All 20 hours of Louisiana CME must be **AMA PRA Category 1** credit.

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] This means:
- NO Category 2 credit accepted
- NO informal CME accepted
- Only formal, accredited CME from AMA-approved providers
- Higher quality standard than states allowing mixed Category 1/Category 2

[CRITICAL - STRICT REQUIREMENT] Louisiana's "all Category 1" requirement is stricter than states allowing informal CME or Category 2 credit. Physicians must ensure all CME is formally accredited.

### CME Provider Accreditation

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] Acceptable CME providers for Category 1 credit include:
- ACCME (Accreditation Council for Continuing Medical Education)
- State medical societies with ACCME accreditation
- Specialty societies with ACCME accreditation
- Medical schools and academic institutions with ACCME accreditation
- AOA Category 1-A (for DO-provided CME that meets AMA Category 1 standards)

[CRITICAL GAP] Whether AOA Category 1-A credit is acceptable for MDs in Louisiana (since board regulates both MD and DO) is not documented.

---

## 4. CME Topic Requirements - Mandatory Topics

### Overview of Mandatory Topics

[FACT - STATUTE] Louisiana has minimal mandatory CME topics: one-time drug diversion requirement for CDS license holders, one-time board orientation for new licensees, and pending nutrition/metabolic health requirement (effective June 20, 2025).

### Topic 1: Drug Diversion Course (3 hours, ONE-TIME, CDS license holders only)

[FACT - STATUTE] Physicians who hold a Louisiana Controlled Dangerous Substance (CDS) license must complete a **3-hour one-time course on drug diversion**.

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] This requirement:
- Is ONE-TIME only (not recurring at each renewal)
- Applies only to physicians with CDS licensure
- Does NOT apply to physicians without CDS licenses

[CRITICAL GAP] When the drug diversion course must be completed:
- Within first renewal after obtaining CDS license?
- Within a specific timeframe after CDS licensure?
- Any time before next renewal?

[RECOMMENDATION] Clarify with LSBME:
1. Timing of drug diversion course requirement
2. Whether this is truly one-time or recurring
3. Acceptable course providers

### Topic 2: Board Orientation Course (ONE-TIME, new licensees only)

[FACT - STATUTE] New licensees (physicians obtaining their first Louisiana medical license) must complete a **one-time board orientation course**.

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] This orientation likely covers:
- Louisiana medical practice laws and regulations
- Board procedures and disciplinary processes
- Professional standards and ethics
- Licensing and renewal requirements

[CRITICAL GAP] Specific details about the board orientation course:
- Is this completed online or in-person?
- How many hours/credits does it provide?
- When must it be completed (before first renewal, within first year, etc.)?
- Does it count toward the 20-hour annual CME requirement?

[RECOMMENDATION] Contact LSBME to clarify orientation course details and timing.

### Topic 3: Nutrition and Metabolic Health (1 hour every 2 years, PENDING, specialty-specific)

[FACT - STATUTE] Louisiana Act 382 of 2024 requires physicians in specific specialties to complete **1 hour of continuing education on nutrition and metabolic health every 2 years**, effective **June 20, 2025**.

[FACT - STATUTE] This requirement applies to physicians practicing in:
- **Family Medicine**
- **Internal Medicine**
- **Pediatrics**
- **Obstetrics and Gynecology**

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] This is a specialty-specific requirement that does NOT apply to all physicians. Specialties outside FM/IM/peds/OB are not required to complete nutrition CME.

**Key Characteristics:**
- **Effective Date:** June 20, 2025
- **Frequency:** Every 2 years (biennial within an annual renewal structure)
- **Hours:** 1 hour
- **Applicability:** FM, IM, pediatrics, OB/GYN only
- **Status:** PENDING IMPLEMENTATION as of research date (Jan 2, 2026)

[CRITICAL - PENDING] As of January 2, 2026, this requirement is NEWLY EFFECTIVE (effective June 20, 2025, which is in the past relative to research date). Physicians in the specified specialties should have already begun compliance if renewing after June 20, 2025.

**Compliance Timeline for Nutrition Requirement:**

| Renewal Date | Nutrition CME Required? |
|--------------|-------------------------|
| Before June 20, 2025 | NO |
| June 20, 2025 - June 19, 2027 | 1 hour nutrition (first 2-year cycle) |
| June 20, 2027 - June 19, 2029 | 1 hour nutrition (second 2-year cycle) |

[CRITICAL GAP] How the 2-year nutrition cycle interacts with annual renewals:
- Is the 1 hour required at a specific renewal within the 2-year window?
- Can it be completed in either year of the 2-year cycle?
- Is tracking based on calendar years or renewal cycles?

[RECOMMENDATION] Contact LSBME to clarify:
1. How nutrition 2-year cycle aligns with annual renewals
2. Acceptable course content and providers
3. Whether this counts toward the 20-hour annual requirement

### Summary of Mandatory Topics

| Topic | Hours | Frequency | Applicability | Effective Date |
|-------|-------|-----------|---------------|----------------|
| Drug Diversion | 3 hrs | ONE-TIME | CDS license holders only | [Date TBD] |
| Board Orientation | [TBD] | ONE-TIME | New licensees only | [Date TBD] |
| Nutrition/Metabolic Health | 1 hr | Every 2 years | FM/IM/peds/OB only | June 20, 2025 |

---

## 5. Specialty-Specific CME Requirements

### Nutrition and Metabolic Health (Specialty-Specific)

[FACT - STATUTE] As detailed in Section 4, physicians practicing in family medicine, internal medicine, pediatrics, or obstetrics/gynecology must complete 1 hour of nutrition and metabolic health CME every 2 years (effective June 20, 2025).

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] This is the ONLY specialty-specific ongoing CME requirement in Louisiana. Other specialties have no additional mandated topics beyond the base 20 hours per year.

### No Other Specialty-Specific Requirements Found

[FACT - STATUTE] Research identified no other specialty-specific CME requirements beyond nutrition/metabolic health for FM/IM/peds/OB.

---

## 6. Exemptions & Special Circumstances

### Board Certification Exemption

[CRITICAL GAP] Whether Louisiana provides exemptions or reductions in CME requirements for physicians holding ABMS or AOA board certification is not documented in available materials.

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] Based on other states' practices, Louisiana may:
- Provide full exemption if board certified within a specific timeframe
- Provide partial credit for MOC activities
- Require full CME regardless of board certification status

[RECOMMENDATION] Contact LSBME to clarify board certification treatment.

### New Licensee Exemption

[CRITICAL GAP] Whether newly licensed physicians are exempt from the 20-hour annual CME requirement for their first renewal is not documented.

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] If Louisiana requires board orientation for new licensees (Section 4, Topic 2), it may:
- Exempt new licensees from CME for first renewal
- Provide CME credit for orientation course
- Require full 20 hours regardless

### CDS License Holder One-Time Requirement

[FACT - STATUTE] The 3-hour drug diversion course is a ONE-TIME requirement for CDS license holders, not a recurring annual or biennial requirement.

### Other Exemptions

[CRITICAL GAP] Whether exemptions exist for:
- Retired physicians
- Inactive licenses
- Military service
- Hardship circumstances
- Resident physicians

These are not documented in available materials.

---

## 7. Regulatory Timeline & Effective Dates

### Nutrition and Metabolic Health CME Implementation

[FACT - STATUTE] Louisiana Act 382 of 2024 established the nutrition and metabolic health CME requirement, effective **June 20, 2025**.

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] As of the research date (January 2, 2026), this requirement has been effective for approximately 6-7 months. Physicians in FM/IM/peds/OB renewing licenses after June 20, 2025 should have already begun compliance.

**Timeline of Louisiana MD CME Regulatory Changes:**

| Date | Requirement | Status | Reference |
|------|-------------|--------|-----------|
| [Date TBD] | 20 hours/year, all Category 1 | EFFECTIVE (baseline) | LAC 46:XLIII |
| [Date TBD] | Drug diversion 3 hrs one-time (CDS holders) | EFFECTIVE | LAC 46:XLIII |
| [Date TBD] | Board orientation one-time (new licensees) | EFFECTIVE | LAC 46:XLIII |
| June 20, 2025 | Nutrition/metabolic health 1 hr/2yr (FM/IM/peds/OB) | EFFECTIVE | Act 382 of 2024 |

[CRITICAL - RECENTLY IMPLEMENTED] The nutrition requirement is NEW as of June 2025. Physicians in affected specialties should verify compliance status for the current 2-year cycle.

---

## 8. Controlled Substance & Opioid Requirements

### Drug Diversion Course (CDS License Holders)

[FACT - STATUTE] Louisiana requires CDS license holders to complete a 3-hour one-time course on drug diversion (see Section 4, Topic 1).

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] This requirement addresses:
- Controlled substance security and storage
- Prescribing practices to prevent diversion
- Recognition of drug-seeking behavior
- Regulatory compliance for CDS licensure

### No Ongoing Opioid CME Requirement Found

[CRITICAL - NOTABLE ABSENCE] Unlike many states that require recurring opioid or pain management CME (e.g., 2 hours every 2 years), Louisiana's drug diversion course is ONE-TIME only for CDS holders.

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] Louisiana's approach is less stringent than states with recurring opioid CME requirements. This simplifies compliance for physicians.

### Federal DEA MATE Act Requirement (Separate from Louisiana State CME)

[FACT - STATUTE] The federal Medication Access and Training Expansion (MATE) Act (effective June 27, 2023) requires physicians applying for or renewing DEA registration to attest they have completed 8 hours of training on opioid or other substance use disorders.

[FACT - STATUTE] The MATE Act requirement is:
- One-time for newly registering physicians (after June 27, 2023)
- Required at DEA registration renewal for continuing registrants
- Separate from Louisiana state CME requirements
- Available as free attestation for recent medical school graduates (graduated within 5 years of June 27, 2023)

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] The federal MATE Act 8-hour requirement is SEPARATE from Louisiana's 3-hour state drug diversion requirement. DEA-registered physicians with CDS licenses must comply with both (8 hours federal + 3 hours state one-time).

---

## 9. CME Tracking & Compliance Verification

### Documentation Requirements

[CRITICAL GAP] Specific documentation requirements (certificates, transcripts, self-attestation, etc.) are not documented in available materials.

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] Based on typical state practice, physicians likely must:
- Maintain certificates of completion for all CME
- Provide documentation upon request or during audit
- Retain records for a specified period (e.g., 5-7 years)
- Verify Category 1 accreditation for all courses

### Audit Procedures

[CRITICAL GAP] Whether the Louisiana State Board of Medical Examiners conducts audits of CME compliance, and if so, the frequency and procedures, is not documented in available materials.

[RECOMMENDATION] Contact LSBME to clarify audit procedures and documentation retention requirements.

---

## 10. Renewal Procedures & Fees

### Standard Renewal Process

[FACT - BOARD] Louisiana physicians renew through the Louisiana State Board of Medical Examiners online portal (exact URL to be verified).

[CRITICAL GAP] The exact renewal portal URL, submission procedures, and renewal window details are not documented in available materials beyond the general board website.

### Renewal Fees

[CRITICAL GAP] The specific annual renewal fee amount for Louisiana medical licenses is not documented in available research materials.

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] Annual renewal fees are typically lower than biennial fees (since they're paid more frequently). Louisiana's annual fee is likely lower than the $400-700 range typical of biennial renewals in other states.

### Grace Period & Late Renewal

[CRITICAL GAP] Grace period mechanics, late fees, and consequences of expired licenses are not documented in available materials.

---

## 11. Annual vs. Biennial Renewal Cycle Implications

### Advantages of Annual Renewal

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] Louisiana's annual renewal structure provides:
1. **Smaller annual CME burden:** 20 hours/year vs. 40-50 hours every 2 years
2. **More frequent compliance touchpoints:** Earlier detection of non-compliance
3. **Flexibility:** Easier to plan CME around annual schedule
4. **Lower per-year financial burden:** Annual fees spread costs evenly

### Disadvantages of Annual Renewal

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] Louisiana's annual renewal structure creates:
1. **More frequent administrative burden:** Renewal process every year vs. every 2-3 years
2. **Higher total administrative time:** Multiple renewal submissions over career
3. **Potential for missed renewals:** More opportunities to forget or miss deadline
4. **Tracking complexity for multi-year topics:** Nutrition requirement (2-year cycle) within annual renewals

### Comparison to Other States

**Louisiana:** 20 hours/year (annual) = 40 hours/2 years = 60 hours/3 years

**Comparable States (Biennial):**
- Georgia: 40 hours/2 years
- Iowa: 40 hours/2 years
- Mississippi: 40 hours/2 years

**Louisiana's requirement is STANDARD** when compared on a 2-year basis, but delivered through an annual renewal cycle.

## Conclusion

Louisiana MD license renewal requirements are **simple with annual structure** (TIER 1) with clear Category 1 specification and minimal mandatory topics.

**Core Requirements Summary:**
- 20 hours CME annually, all AMA PRA Category 1
- One-time: Drug diversion (3 hrs, CDS holders), board orientation (new licensees)
- Specialty-specific: Nutrition/metabolic health (1 hr every 2 years for FM/IM/peds/OB, effective June 20, 2025)
- Annual renewal cycle (unique among states, most use biennial)

**Key Simplicity Factors:**
1. Annual 20-hour requirement = straightforward annual tracking (40 hrs/2yr equivalent)
2. All Category 1 requirement = clear quality standard, no mixed categories
3. Minimal mandatory topics (one-time requirements, single specialty-specific 2-year topic)
4. Annual renewal = smaller annual burden, more frequent compliance touchpoints

**Key Complexity Considerations:**
1. Annual renewal = more frequent administrative process
2. Nutrition 2-year cycle within annual renewals creates tracking complexity for FM/IM/peds/OB
3. Newly effective nutrition requirement (June 20, 2025) requires specialty physician attention

**For Physician Compliance:** Complete 20 hours Category 1 CME annually. CDS license holders: complete 3-hour drug diversion course (one-time). New licensees: complete board orientation. FM/IM/peds/OB physicians: complete 1 hour nutrition/metabolic health CME every 2 years (effective June 20, 2025). Verify annual renewal deadline with board.

**For Rules Engine Implementation:** Primary challenge is tracking annual renewal cycle (less common than biennial). Nutrition requirement creates 2-year sub-cycle within annual renewals for specific specialties. One-time requirements (drug diversion, orientation) need completion status tracking. Category 1 requirement must be validated for all CME.

**Critical Next Steps:**
1. Contact Louisiana State Board of Medical Examiners at (504) 568-6820 to clarify:
   - Annual renewal deadline structure and dates
   - Nutrition 2-year cycle alignment with annual renewals
   - Board certification exemption status
   - Drug diversion and orientation course details and timing
   - Renewal fees, grace period, and procedures
   - Audit and documentation requirements
2. Review Louisiana Act 382 of 2024 for nutrition requirement details
3. Monitor LSBME website for implementation guidance on nutrition CME
