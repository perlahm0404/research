comprehensive research prompt document. This is a detailed framework for validating CME (Continuing Medical Education) renewal requirements across US state medical boards, with Maryland (MD) as your target state.
Key Understanding of Your Request
You want me to:

Research Maryland's state medical board renewal requirements using this rigorous framework
Create a narrative-only deliverable (not the full YAML structure yet)
Focus on renewal requirements only - not initial licensing
Follow the split-board recognition protocol (MD has separate MD and DO boards)
Validate against FSMB data for discrepancies

Before I Proceed - I Have Questions

Scope Confirmation: Should I research BOTH Maryland's MD board AND DO board requirements, or just the MD board?
Output Format: When you say "create the narrative only," do you want:

The detailed prose narrative with full quotes and source citations (like a findings document)?
Or a summary narrative that's more concise?


Depth Level: Should I aim for comprehensive coverage (all 14 questions including medical marijuana, audit procedures, fees, etc.), or focus on core requirements (total hours, topics, verification)?
FSMB Comparison: Should I compare the Maryland findings to FSMB's current data on Maryland and flag discrepancies?
Timeline: Are you working with a specific deadline for this research?

Once you clarify these points, I'll dive deep into Maryland's State Board of Physicians website, Maryland statutes, administrative code, and create the narrative document you need for your MD board review.oklahoma state for MD physicians only

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Oklahoma requires MD physicians to renew their licenses at regular intervals of no less than one (1) time per annum (minimum annually) per Oklahoma Statute 59 O.S. § 495a.1(A). The most critical finding regarding CME requirements is found in Section C of the statute, which mandates pain management and opioid education requirements.
Key Requirements for MD Renewal:

CME Mandate: While the statute authorizes the Board to require CME for reregistration (Section B), the specific total hour requirement must be determined from Board rules and administrative code.
Pain Management/Opioid CME: The statute explicitly requires "not less than one (1) hour of education in pain management or one (1) hour of education in opioid use or addiction each year preceding an application for renewal of a license" (59 O.S. § 495a.1(C)) - CRITICAL FACT
DEA Exemption: This pain/opioid education requirement applies UNLESS "the licensee has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Board that the licensee does not currently hold a valid federal Drug Enforcement Administration registration number" (59 O.S. § 495a.1(C))
Non-Compliance Penalty: Failure to meet CME requirements in the allotted time may result in "a nondisciplinary fine by the Board secretary of up to but not more than One Thousand Dollars ($1,000.00)" (59 O.S. § 495a.1(B))
Attestation: Licensees must "sign and attest to the veracity of the application form for license reregistration. Failure to report fully and correctly shall be grounds for disciplinary action by the Board." (59 O.S. § 495a.1(D))


STATUTORY FRAMEWORK

Source Type: STATE_STATUTE
Last Verified: January 1, 2026
URL: https://law.justia.com/codes/oklahoma/title-59/section-59-495a-1/
Statutory Authority & Renewal Frequency (Section A):

"At regular intervals set by the State Board of Medical Licensure and Supervision, no less than one time per annum, each licensee licensed by the Oklahoma Allopathic Medical and Surgical Licensure and Supervision Act shall demonstrate to the Board the licensee's continuing qualification to practice medicine and surgery."

[FACT] The statute establishes that renewal occurs at regular intervals of NO LESS THAN one time per annum (minimum annually), with the specific intervals set by the Board of Medical Licensure and Supervision. This creates a minimum frequency but does not specify whether renewals are actually annual, biennial, or triennial.
The same section mandates that licensees "apply for license reregistration on a form or forms provided by the Board" and report extensive information including:

Any disciplinary actions from any jurisdiction
Adverse judgments, settlements, or awards from professional liability claims
Voluntary surrender/limitation of licenses in any jurisdiction
Denial of licenses by any jurisdiction
Voluntary resignation from medical staff during investigations
Voluntary resignation from medical societies during investigations
Substance abuse/addiction history
Physical injury, disease, or mental illness affecting practice
Completion of continuing medical education or professional maintenance/evaluation, including specialty board certification (Section A, subsection 9)

[FACT] CME Requirement Authorization (Section B):

"The Board may require continuing medical education for license reregistration and require documentation of that education. The Board shall promulgate rules on the specific requirements of the amount of continuing medical education needed for reregistration."

This grants the Board authority to establish CME requirements through administrative rules. The statute does NOT specify a mandatory total hour requirement in Section B - it delegates this to the Board's rule-making authority.
[FACT] Mandatory Pain Management/Opioid CME Requirement (Section C) - CRITICAL:

"The Board shall require that the licensee receive not less than one (1) hour of education in pain management or one (1) hour of education in opioid use or addiction each year preceding an application for renewal of a license, unless the licensee has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Board that the licensee does not currently hold a valid federal Drug Enforcement Administration registration number."

Key Points from Section C:

Minimum Requirement: At least 1 hour (not "less than one") of pain management OR opioid/addiction education
Frequency: EACH YEAR (not per cycle) - This is annual
Timing: Education must occur in the year preceding the renewal application
DEA Exemption: Applies ONLY IF the licensee demonstrates they do NOT hold a valid DEA registration number
Affirmative Requirement: "The Board SHALL require" (mandatory, not discretionary)

[FACT] Non-Compliance Penalties (Section B):

"Failure to meet the requirements in the allotted time may result in the licensee being required to pay a nondisciplinary fine by the Board secretary of up to but not more than One Thousand Dollars ($1,000.00)."

This establishes a penalty for non-compliance, but the statute specifies it is a nondisciplinary fine (not a disciplinary action leading to license suspension, which would require hearing rights).
[FACT] Attestation Requirement (Section D):

"The licensee shall sign and attest to the veracity of the application form for license reregistration. Failure to report fully and correctly shall be grounds for disciplinary action by the Board."

The attestation requirement creates both a verification mechanism (honor system) and grounds for disciplinary action if false information is submitted.
[FACT] Board Authority to Investigate (Section E):

"The Board shall establish a system for reviewing reregistration forms. The Board may initiate investigations and disciplinary proceedings based on information submitted by licensees for license reregistration."

This establishes that the Board has authority to audit/investigate based on renewal form submissions.
[FACT] Fitness Determination & License Issuance (Section F):

"Upon a finding by the Board that the licensee is fit to continue to practice medicine and surgery in this state, the Board shall issue to the licensee a license to practice medicine and surgery during the next registration period."

This is the final approval mechanism - the Board makes a fitness determination before issuing the renewed license.
Statutory Amendments (for context):

Original statute: Laws 1994, c. 323, § 20, effective July 1, 1994
First amendment: Laws 2018, c. 175, § 1, effective November 1, 2018
Second amendment: Laws 2019, c. 492, § 3, effective November 1, 2019 (likely added the pain management/opioid education requirement)


ONLINE RENEWAL PORTAL INFORMATION
Portal URL: https://pay.apps.ok.gov/medlic/md/
Portal Operator: Oklahoma Government Services
Source Type: PORTAL_INSTRUCTIONS
Last Verified: January 1, 2026
The online renewal portal provides physicians with a three-step process for license renewal:
[FACT] Step 1 - LOGIN
Physicians enter their license number and PIN (which defaults to the last 4 digits of the Social Security number). The portal allows physicians to access and update their addresses and practice information at any time.
[FACT] Step 2 - ANSWER QUESTIONS
Physicians access the mandatory questions page, which corresponds to the reporting requirements outlined in Statute 59 O.S. § 495a.1(A). These questions capture:

Disciplinary actions by any jurisdiction
Adverse judgments and settlements
License surrenders/limitations
Medical society resignation information
Substance abuse/addiction
Health conditions affecting practice
CME completion during the previous registration period

[FACT] Step 3 - MAKE PAYMENT
Physicians select a payment type (Credit Card, Electronic Fund Transfer, or Mailed Check). The system processes payment and produces a receipt or printable renewal form.
The portal welcome message states: "Your information will be updated on the Web site within 24 hours" - indicating that renewal data is posted to the public directory within one business day.

CME TRACKING SYSTEM
System: CE Broker
URL: https://secure.okmedicalboard.org/cme/ and https://cebroker.com/OK/plans
Source Type: CME_TRACKING_SYSTEM
Last Verified: January 1, 2026
[FACT] Oklahoma Board of Medical Licensure and Supervision uses CE Broker as the official CME tracking system. Both MD and DO physicians use the same system (CE Broker), though they may have different CME requirements (DO board is separate).
The CME module on the board website includes course materials for required topics, particularly "Oklahoma Health Care Providers' Responsibilities and Rights Under Certain Medical Treatment Laws" - this appears to be related to healthcare provider rights education, which is a common CME requirement in Oklahoma.
[INFERENCE] The CE Broker system likely auto-reports CME completion to the Board, reducing the burden on physicians to manually submit certificates, but this has not been confirmed through explicit documentation.

RESEARCH FINDINGS: PHASE 1 - FIRST RENEWAL/NEWLY LICENSED PHYSICIANS
[CRITICAL GAP - HIGH]: The statute does NOT explicitly state a grace period for newly licensed physicians. Section A states that renewal occurs "at regular intervals set by the State Board of Medical Licensure and Supervision, no less than one time per annum" but does not address whether newly licensed physicians have a different timeline.
Question for Research: Do Oklahoma physicians licensed mid-year have to complete CME immediately, or do they have until the next renewal cycle to begin?
What we know:

CME can be completed and reported via the CE Broker system
The pain management/opioid CME must be completed "each year preceding an application for renewal"
The Board has established a renewal system through CE Broker

Assumption Pending Verification: Based on common practice in other states, Oklahoma likely provides a grace period (possibly 3 years from initial licensure) before the first CME requirement takes effect, but this is not explicitly stated in the statute.

RESEARCH FINDINGS: PHASE 2 - ONGOING RENEWALS
Total CME Hours Requirement
[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] Based on the AI search overview result visible during research, Oklahoma requires 60 hours of AMA PRA Category 1 CME every three (3) years (triennial) for license renewal.
Evidence Supporting this:

Search results indicated "60 hours of AMA PRA Category 1 CME every three (3) years"
This is consistent with the pain management/opioid CME requirement being annual while total CME is triennial
The renewal frequency language "no less than one time per annum" is consistent with triennial renewal (meeting annually to report, with license valid for 3 years)

[CRITICAL GAP - CRITICAL] The specific total CME hour requirement (60 hours) and the triennial cycle (3 years) is NOT found in Statute 59 O.S. § 495a.1 itself. Section B states "The Board shall promulgate rules on the specific requirements of the amount of continuing medical education needed for reregistration" - meaning this requirement must be found in Oklahoma Administrative Code (OAC).
Recommended Follow-Up: Search OAC Title 435 (Board of Medical Licensure and Supervision) for sections covering CME requirements. Likely sections: 435:10-15-1 or similar administrative code sections.
Pain Management and Opioid CME - CONFIRMED REQUIREMENT
[FACT] Oklahoma Statute 59 O.S. § 495a.1(C) mandates:

"The Board shall require that the licensee receive not less than one (1) hour of education in pain management or one (1) hour of education in opioid use or addiction each year preceding an application for renewal of a license, unless the licensee has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Board that the licensee does not currently hold a valid federal Drug Enforcement Administration registration number."

Requirements Breakdown:
AspectRequirementTopicPain management OR opioid use/addiction educationHoursMinimum 1 hourFrequencyEACH YEAR (annual)TimingYear preceding renewal applicationDEA ExemptionApplies if physician does NOT hold valid DEA registrationStatutory Authority59 O.S. § 495a.1(C)Classification[FACT] - Explicit statutory requirement
[INFERENCE] The annual frequency of pain/opioid CME (contrasted with a triennial overall CME cycle) suggests that physicians must complete 1 hour per year × 3 years = minimum 3 hours of pain/opioid CME per triennial cycle.
[ASSUMPTION] The statute says "pain management OR opioid use or addiction" - this appears to be interpreted as either topic satisfying the requirement, not both. This is a logical reading but should be confirmed with the Board.
CME Category Requirements
[INFERENCE - LOW CONFIDENCE] Based on the search result mentioning "AMA PRA Category 1 CME," Oklahoma likely requires AMA-approved Category 1 continuing medical education.
[CRITICAL GAP - HIGH] The statute does NOT specify category requirements (Category 1 vs Category 2, AOA vs AMA). This must be confirmed in Board administrative rules.
CME Topic Requirements Beyond Pain Management
[CRITICAL GAP - HIGH] The statute explicitly requires only:

Pain management or opioid education (annually)

[ASSUMPTION] Oklahoma may have additional topic-specific CME requirements for:

Healthcare provider rights/responsibilities (there is a CME course available on the Board website for this)
Prescribing standards
Other mandated topics (human trafficking, child abuse, implicit bias, etc.)

Recommended Research: Review Oklahoma Administrative Code Title 435 and Board FAQs for additional topic-specific mandates beyond pain management/opioid education.
Renewal Fees and Timeline
[INFERENCE - VERY LOW CONFIDENCE] The portal allows renewal 60 days before license expiration (based on "renewal notice sent 60 days before expiration" language in the helpful hints section).
[CRITICAL GAP - CRITICAL] Specific information needed:

Renewal fee amount
Late fee amount and grace period
Late renewal cutoff
License status during grace period (active, inactive, suspended)
Late fee timeline

Recommended Research: Access the Online Bill Pay portal or Board contact information for fee schedules.
Verification and Audit Process
[FACT] Section E of the statute states:

"The Board shall establish a system for reviewing reregistration forms. The Board may initiate investigations and disciplinary proceedings based on information submitted by licensees for license reregistration."

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE]

Verification Method: Attestation (physicians attest to CME completion via the online form)
Audit Type: The Board "may initiate" investigations - suggesting discretionary/for-cause audits rather than mandatory random audits
Audit Trigger: Information submitted in renewal forms could trigger audit

[CRITICAL GAP - HIGH]

What percentage of physicians are audited annually?
What documentation must physicians retain for audit purposes?
What is the audit response timeline?
What retention period is required (3 years? current cycle + 1 year?)?


RESEARCH FINDINGS: EXEMPTIONS AND ALTERNATIVES
Board Certification Exemption
[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] Statute 59 O.S. § 495a.1(A)(9) requires physicians to report "completion of continuing medical education or other forms of professional maintenance or evaluation, including specialty board certification or recertification, during the previous registration period."
The fact that board certification is mentioned as part of what must be REPORTED suggests it may be recognized as an alternative or partial satisfaction of CME, but the statute does not explicitly state this.
[CRITICAL GAP - HIGH] Does ABMS board certification obtain/renew during the renewal period satisfy part or all of the CME requirement? If so, how much credit is given?
DEA-Conditional Exemption
[FACT] The pain management/opioid CME exemption (Section C) is the only explicit exemption in the statute:

"...unless the licensee has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Board that the licensee does not currently hold a valid federal Drug Enforcement Administration registration number."

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE]

Physicians without DEA registration do NOT need to complete the 1-hour pain/opioid CME requirement
Physicians must affirmatively "demonstrate" the lack of DEA registration (likely by declaration in the renewal form)
Obtaining a DEA registration mid-cycle would create a requirement to complete the pain/opioid CME by the next renewal

[CRITICAL GAP - MEDIUM] What documentation is required to prove lack of DEA registration? Is a simple attestation sufficient, or must physicians submit DEA non-registration proof?

RESEARCH FINDINGS: CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE PRESCRIBING CONTEXT
Why Pain Management CME Exists
The pain management and opioid education requirement in 59 O.S. § 495a.1(C) exists within a broader framework of Oklahoma's prescribing regulations. While the research prompt notes this is out of scope, understanding the context is helpful:
[CONTEXT - INFERENCE] Oklahoma has implemented mandatory pain management/opioid CME as part of a national trend to address the opioid crisis. The requirement applies to DEA-registered physicians (those with prescribing authority for controlled substances), creating a direct nexus between prescribing authority and CME obligation.
The statute's language "or one (1) hour of education in opioid use or addiction" suggests Oklahoma recognizes both pain management education and addiction/opioid-specific education as satisfying the requirement - providing flexibility for physicians with different specialties.

RESEARCH FINDINGS: NON-COMPLIANCE AND PENALTIES
Late Fees
[FACT] Statute 59 O.S. § 495a.1(B) establishes:

"Failure to meet the requirements in the allotted time may result in the licensee being required to pay a nondisciplinary fine by the Board secretary of up to but not more than One Thousand Dollars ($1,000.00)."

Key Points:

Amount: Up to $1,000 (not exceeding)
Type: Nondisciplinary fine (NOT a disciplinary action)
Authority: Board secretary can impose
Timing: Required if CME not completed "in the allotted time"

[CRITICAL GAP - HIGH] What is "the allotted time"? Is it:

At the renewal deadline?
Some grace period after the deadline?
Determined by Board rule?

License Status During Non-Compliance
[CRITICAL GAP - CRITICAL] The statute does NOT specify what happens to the license if CME is not completed:

Does it become inactive immediately?
Is there a grace period?
Is suspension automatic or by Board action?
Can physicians continue practicing while making up CME?

Remediation
[CRITICAL GAP - HIGH] What are the remediation options if a physician fails to complete CME in time?

Must they complete all hours immediately?
Is there a probation period?
Can they complete hours retroactively?

Disciplinary Action
[FACT] Statute 59 O.S. § 495a.1(D) states:

"The licensee shall sign and attest to the veracity of the application form for license reregistration. Failure to report fully and correctly shall be grounds for disciplinary action by the Board."

[INFERENCE] Failure to accurately report CME completion (not just failure to complete CME) is grounds for disciplinary action. This suggests:

False attestation = disciplinary grounds
Non-completion = fine (unless also false attestation)
Possible disciplinary outcomes: warning, probation, suspension, revocation


COMPARISON TO FSMB DATA

The following requirements are confirmed and can be implemented immediately:

Pain Management/Opioid CME: Minimum 1 hour per year, required for DEA holders
Attestation-Based Verification: Physicians attest to CME completion
Non-Compliance Fine: Up to $1,000 for failure to complete

Pending Gate Items - MUST RESOLVE BEFORE PRODUCTION
The following gaps must be resolved before implementing the rules engine:

Total CME Hours: Confirm 60 hours vs. other amounts from OAC
Renewal Frequency: Confirm triennial vs. annual/biennial from OAC
Additional Topic Requirements: Search OAC for healthcare rights, prescribing, etc.
Category Requirements: Confirm AMA Category 1 requirement
Audit/Retention: Establish audit trigger points and retention requirements
Medical Marijuana CME: Determine if this is a new 2026 requirement

Recommended Research Sequence

First: Access Oklahoma Administrative Code Title 435, Part 10 (Medical Board rules on CME)
Second: Contact Oklahoma State Board of Medical Licensure and Supervision directly:

Phone: (405) 962-1400
Address: 101 NE 51st St., Oklahoma City, OK 73105-1821


Third: Review Board FAQ page and renewal portal instructions for operational details
Fourth: Cross-reference with FSMB CME State Comparison document for accuracy


CONCLUSION
Oklahoma MD physician license renewal is governed primarily by Oklahoma Statute 59 O.S. § 495a.1, which establishes a mandatory renewal framework with two confirmed CME requirements:

Discretionary Total CME (to be determined by Board rules) - likely 60 hours every 3 years
Mandatory Pain Management/Opioid CME - 1 hour per year (unless DEA non-holder)

The statute is explicit and authoritative on pain management/opioid education but delegates other CME specifics to the Board's administrative rules, which must be researched in Oklahoma Administrative Code Title 435.
Non-compliance carries a potential fine of up to $1,000 and possible disciplinary action if false information is attested. Physicians attest to CME completion through the online portal (CE Broker system), with the Board maintaining authority to audit and investigate.
Research Completion Status: 35% complete - CME core requirements identified, but administrative code research needed for full scope.
