## 1. Board Information & Regulatory Authority

### Official Board Information

[FACT - BOARD] The Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation (IDFPR) is the official regulatory agency for physicians in Illinois. Website: https://idfpr.illinois.gov. Phone: 1-800-560-6420. (Accessed 2026-01-02)

[FACT - STATUTE] The IDFPR Medical Licensing Board's authority derives from the Illinois Medical Practice Act of 1987 (225 ILCS 60/1 et seq.).

### Primary Statutory Framework

[FACT - STATUTE] 68 Illinois Administrative Code § 1285.110 is the primary regulation governing continuing medical education requirements for physicians. This section establishes the 150-hour CME requirement per 36-month renewal cycle. Source: https://www.law.cornell.edu/regulations/illinois/Ill-Admin-Code-tit-68-SS-1285.110

[FACT - ADMIN_CODE] Illinois Medical Practice Act of 1987 establishes the statutory foundation for licensure, renewal, and CME compliance.

[FACT - BOARD] Renewal portal: https://online-dfpr.micropact.com/

---

## 2. Renewal Cycle & Dates

### Triennial Renewal Schedule (Every 3 Years)

[FACT - STATUTE] Illinois physicians renew their medical licenses every 36 months (triennial), rather than the more common biennial (2-year) cycle. 68 Ill Adm Code § 1285.110(a).

[FACT - STATUTE] The renewal deadline is **July 31** every third year. For the 2026 renewal cycle, the deadline is **July 31, 2026**. Physicians are required to renew their licenses every three years. (Source: IDFPR License Renewal Information)

[FACT - STATUTE] The pre-renewal period (when CME must be completed) runs from **August 1 of the prior year through July 31 of the renewal year**. For the 2026 renewal, the pre-renewal period is August 1, 2023 through July 31, 2026.

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] The 3-year cycle is longer than most states, providing more time to accumulate CME hours but requiring higher total hours (150 vs 48-50 in many states).

### Renewal Timeline & Submission Windows

[FACT - BOARD] Physicians may renew online through eLicense approximately **2-3 months prior** to the expiration date (July 31).

[FACT - BOARD] Specific grace period and late fee information is not documented in the statute or accessible board materials reviewed. This should be clarified with IDFPR.

---

## 3. CME Requirements - Base Hours & Categories

### Total CME Hours Required

[FACT - STATUTE] Illinois requires **150 continuing medical education hours every 36 months (triennial renewal cycle)**. 68 Ill Adm Code § 1285.110(a).

### Formal vs. Informal CME Balance

[FACT - STATUTE] Of the 150 required hours:
- **Minimum 60 hours must be formal CME programs** (approved by ACCME or state-recognized accreditors)
- **Maximum 90 hours may be informal CME programs** (self-study, hospital lectures, grand rounds, archived webinars, podcasts, DVDs, etc.)

(68 Ill Adm Code § 1285.110(a)(1) & (2))

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] Illinois's mixed formal/informal approach provides flexibility. Physicians cannot complete CME entirely from informal sources (at least 40% must be formal), but can count up to 60% from informal activities.

### CME Categories & Formats

[FACT - STATUTE] Acceptable CME includes:
- **Formal programs:** ACCME-accredited courses, state-recognized specialty society courses, educational activities with scientific/clinical content bearing on quality or cost-effective patient care
- **Informal programs:** Enduring materials (podcasts, CD-ROMs, DVDs, archived webinars, printed materials), live activities (specialty meetings, workshops, webinars, grand rounds, case conferences)
- **Specialty board certification programs:** Count toward CME requirement (but do not appear to exempt from the 150-hour total)

(68 Ill Adm Code § 1285.110)

[CRITICAL GAP] The statute does not specify whether AMA PRA Category 2 credit, AOA credit, or other formats are acceptable. Specificity on acceptable categories would clarify compliance requirements.

### CME Provider Requirements

[FACT - STATUTE] CME providers seeking formal CME approval must:
- Submit an application with required documentation
- Pay a $2,000 nonrefundable application fee (state agencies, state colleges, and state universities exempt)
- Verify participant completion and provide certificates of attendance

(68 Ill Adm Code § 1285.110)

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] The $2,000 provider fee creates a barrier to new CME providers and may influence the available CME options for physicians.

---

## 4. CME Topic Requirements - Mandatory Topics

### Overview of Mandatory Topics

[FACT - STATUTE] Illinois has multiple mandatory CME topics distributed across the 3-year renewal cycle and 6-year sub-cycles. All mandatory topics count toward the 150-hour requirement (not in addition).

### Topic 1: Sexual Harassment Prevention (1 hour, 3-year cycle, MANDATORY)

[FACT - STATUTE] All physicians must complete **1 hour of continuing education on sexual harassment prevention** every 3 years. This requirement became effective **March 2023**.

[FACT - STATUTE] The requirement is based on **Public Act 101-0221** (the Workplace Transparency Act), which mandates sexual harassment prevention training for healthcare professionals.

(Source: Illinois Academy of Family Physicians; IDFPR CME Requirements)

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] This is a per-cycle requirement (every 3 years), not one-time. Physicians must satisfy this requirement at each renewal.

[CRITICAL GAP] Specific acceptable courses or course content standards for sexual harassment prevention CME are not detailed in statute or accessible materials.

### Topic 2: Implicit Bias (1 hour, 3-year cycle, MANDATORY)

[FACT - STATUTE] All physicians must complete **1 hour of continuing education on implicit bias awareness** every 3 years. This requirement became effective **January 1, 2023**.

[FACT - STATUTE] The requirement is based on **Public Act 102-0004**, which mandates implicit bias awareness training for healthcare professionals.

(Source: IDFPR CME Requirements; ISMS License Requirement FAQs)

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] This is a per-cycle requirement (every 3 years), not one-time. Combined with sexual harassment prevention (1 hr), physicians must complete at least 2 hours of topic-specific CME per 3-year cycle.

[FACT - BOARD] Implicit bias training options include general implicit bias courses and maternal healthcare-focused implicit bias courses. The IPROMOTEIL initiative developed resources in response to Public Act 102-0004 and offers maternal health equity-focused training.

### Topic 3: Opioids (1 hour, 6-year sub-cycle, CONDITIONAL)

[FACT - STATUTE] Physicians who hold an **Illinois Controlled Substance License** (DEA registration for controlled substance prescribing) must complete **1 hour of CME on safe opioid prescribing** every 6 years.

(Source: ISMS Illinois Medical License Requirement FAQs)

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] This is a conditional requirement based on controlled substance licensure, not applicable to all physicians. The 6-year cycle means this requirement aligns with every second 3-year renewal cycle.

[CRITICAL GAP] Specific acceptable course content for opioid CME is not detailed. Is this separate from general pain management CME, or can general pain management courses satisfy the requirement?

### Topic 4: Cultural Competency (1 hour, 6-year sub-cycle, MANDATORY)

[FACT - STATUTE] All physicians must complete **1 hour of continuing education on cultural competency** every 6 years. This requirement became effective **January 1, 2025**.

[FACT - STATUTE] Cultural competency is defined as "a set of integrated attitudes, knowledge, and skills that enables a healthcare professional or organization to care effectively for patients from diverse cultures, groups, and communities."

(Source: ISMS Illinois Medical License Requirement FAQs)

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] This is a newer requirement (effective Jan 1, 2025) and applies to all physicians. The 6-year cycle means physicians have until their second renewal cycle to complete this requirement.

[CRITICAL GAP] Specific acceptable courses or content standards for cultural competency CME are not detailed.

### Topic 5: Dementia/Alzheimer's (1 hour, 6-year sub-cycle, MANDATORY)

[FACT - STATUTE] All physicians must complete **1 hour of continuing education on recognizing and managing Alzheimer's disease and other dementias** every 6 years.

[FACT - STATUTE] The requirement applies to physicians with "direct patient interaction with adults aged 26 and above." Physicians licensed for the first time during the 2023-2026 licensure period must complete the training once before renewal in 2026, then have 6 years before the next requirement.

(Source: Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias Services Act, 110 ILCS 905/)

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] This is a 6-year sub-cycle requirement, meaning physicians must complete this every other renewal cycle (every 6 years).

[CRITICAL INTERPRETATION] For new licensees in the 2023-2026 cycle:
- **Must complete by July 31, 2026** (first renewal)
- **Next required completion:** 6 years later, by 2032

For established physicians (those who did not need the training for the 2023-2026 cycle):
- **First required completion:** 6-year cycle beginning date (likely Aug 1, 2023 or earlier)
- **Next required completion:** 6 years after first completion

[CRITICAL GAP] The exact start date of the 6-year cycle for established physicians is unclear. Some physicians may have already completed this requirement in the 2023-2026 cycle, while others may not need it until the 2026-2029 cycle or later.

### Topic 6: Maternal Health Equity (PENDING - Potentially Effective July 1, 2026)

[CRITICAL - PENDING] Research identified references to a pending **maternal health equity CME requirement**, potentially effective **July 1, 2026**, but this requirement has **NOT been finalized or published as of January 2, 2026**.

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] Based on the IPROMOTEIL initiative and references to maternal health-focused implicit bias training, it is likely that Illinois will implement a maternal health equity or maternal health-focused CME requirement. However, the specific hours, content, applicability (OB/GYN only vs. all physicians), and effective date are unknown.

**Status: PENDING IMPLEMENTATION** - Physicians should monitor IDFPR website for final rule adoption. The July 1, 2026 date may be aspirational but not yet finalized.

[RECOMMENDATION] Contact IDFPR at 1-800-560-6420 for confirmation of maternal health equity CME requirement status, hours required, and effective date.

### Summary of Mandatory Topics & Timing

| Topic | Hours | Cycle | Effective Date | Applicability |
|-------|-------|-------|---|---|
| Sexual Harassment Prevention | 1 hr | Every 3 years | March 2023 | All physicians |
| Implicit Bias | 1 hr | Every 3 years | January 1, 2023 | All physicians |
| Opioids | 1 hr | Every 6 years | (existing) | DEA registrants only |
| Cultural Competency | 1 hr | Every 6 years | January 1, 2025 | All physicians |
| Dementia/Alzheimer's | 1 hr | Every 6 years | (existing) | All with adult patient interaction |
| **Maternal Health Equity** | **TBD** | **TBD** | **Pending July 1, 2026** | **TBD (likely OB/GYN)** |

---

## 5. Complexity of 3-Year and 6-Year Sub-Cycles

### Three-Year Renewal Cycle Structure

[FACT - STATUTE] Each 3-year renewal cycle requires 150 hours CME with mandatory topics:
- Sexual harassment prevention: 1 hour
- Implicit bias: 1 hour
- Remaining 148 hours: flexible (must include 6-year cycle topics as applicable)

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] Every 3-year renewal, physicians must complete both sexual harassment and implicit bias training.

### Six-Year Sub-Cycle Structure (Complex Overlapping Requirements)

[FACT - STATUTE] The 6-year sub-cycle topics (opioids, cultural competency, dementia) are completed once every 6 years, which means:

**Renewal Cycles 2023-2026 and 2026-2029:**
- 2023-2026 cycle: May include first instance of 6-year topics (cultural competency required for all by Jan 1, 2025; opioids and dementia timing depends on physician's prior completion)
- 2026-2029 cycle: Second 3-year cycle within the 6-year period - 6-year topics NOT due again until 2029-2032 cycle

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] The 6-year sub-cycle creates variable compliance requirements depending on when a physician last completed the 6-year topics.

### Example Compliance Timeline

**Physician licensed in 2024 (first time in 2023-2026 cycle):**
- 2026 renewal: 150 hours + sexual harassment (1) + implicit bias (1) + cultural competency (1) + dementia (1) + opioids (1, if DEA registered) = 155 hours total
- 2029 renewal: 150 hours + sexual harassment (1) + implicit bias (1) + [6-year topics NOT due] = 152 hours total
- 2032 renewal: 150 hours + sexual harassment (1) + implicit bias (1) + cultural competency (1) + dementia (1) + opioids (1, if DEA registered) = 155 hours total

**Established physician completing 2020-2023 cycle:**
- 2023 renewal: 150 hours (6-year topics completed in prior cycle)
- 2026 renewal: 150 hours + sexual harassment (1) + implicit bias (1) + cultural competency (1, if not completed in 2023-2026 period) + dementia (1, if due) + opioids (1, if DEA registered and due) = 152-155 hours
- 2029 renewal: 150 hours + sexual harassment (1) + implicit bias (1) = 152 hours

[CRITICAL - HIGH COMPLEXITY] The 6-year sub-cycle creates timing complexity that requires physicians to track not just the 3-year renewal cycle, but also which 6-year topics are due in each specific cycle. This is a significant source of compliance difficulty.

---

## 6. Exemptions & Special Circumstances

### First-Time Renewal Exemption

[FACT - STATUTE] Physicians renewing their license for the first time are **exempt from CME requirements** for their initial renewal. 68 Ill Adm Code § 1285.110(d).

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] Only the first renewal is exempt. All subsequent renewals require full 150-hour CME compliance.

### Reinstatement & Inactive License Reactivation

[FACT - STATUTE] Physicians reinstating a license from expired or inactive status may have CME exemptions during the reinstatement period. 68 Ill Adm Code § 1285.130.

[CRITICAL GAP] Specific reinstatement CME requirements and timelines are not detailed in the materials reviewed. This should be clarified with IDFPR.

### Board Certification Exemption (Status Unclear)

[CRITICAL - NO EXEMPTION FOUND IN STATUTE] Research found NO explicit exemption in 68 Ill Adm Code § 1285.110 for physicians holding board certification (ABMS, AOA, etc.).

[FACT - STATUTE] The statute states that "specialty board certification programs" count toward CME requirements, but does not exempt physicians from the 150-hour total.

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] Unlike Texas, Arizona, and some other states, Illinois does NOT appear to provide a CME exemption for board-certified physicians. However, board certification activities (MOC programs, etc.) count toward the 150-hour requirement.

[RECOMMENDATION] Contact IDFPR to confirm whether ABMS board certification in maintenance status provides any CME exemption or reduction.

---

## 7. Regulatory Timeline & Effective Dates

### Chronological History of Illinois CME Requirements

[FACT - STATUTE] Illinois's CME requirement has been in place for many years, with incremental amendments adding mandatory topics.

**Timeline of Illinois MD CME Regulatory Changes:**

| Date | Requirement | Status | Reference |
|------|-------------|--------|-----------|
| Prior to 2020 | 150 hours/3yr, 60 hrs formal | Baseline | 68 Ill Adm Code § 1285.110 |
| March 2023 | Sexual Harassment Prevention CME (1 hr per cycle) | EFFECTIVE | Public Act 101-0221 |
| January 1, 2023 | Implicit Bias CME (1 hr per cycle) | EFFECTIVE | Public Act 102-0004 |
| January 1, 2025 | Cultural Competency CME (1 hr every 6 yrs) | EFFECTIVE | Illinois Administrative Code |
| (Existing) | Opioid CME (1 hr every 6 yrs, DEA registrants only) | ONGOING | Controlled Substance Law |
| (Existing) | Dementia CME (1 hr every 6 yrs) | ONGOING | Alzheimer's Disease Act |
| July 1, 2026 | **Maternal Health Equity CME (PENDING)** | **PENDING** | **Status TBD** |
| July 31, 2026 | Next renewal deadline (2026 cycle) | CURRENT | IDFPR |

[FACT - STATUTE] Sexual Harassment Prevention and Implicit Bias became mandatory in March 2023 and January 1, 2023 respectively, affecting physicians renewing in 2026.

[FACT - STATUTE] Cultural Competency CME became mandatory January 1, 2025, affecting the 2026 renewal cycle and beyond.

**Current Compliance Expectation (for July 31, 2026 renewal):**
- All physicians: 150 hours CME (60 formal, max 90 informal)
- All physicians: 1 hr sexual harassment prevention
- All physicians: 1 hr implicit bias
- All physicians: 1 hr cultural competency (required by Jan 1, 2025)
- All physicians with adult patients: 1 hr dementia (timing depends on prior completion)
- DEA registrants: 1 hr opioid CME (timing depends on prior completion)
- **PENDING:** Maternal health equity CME (hours/requirements TBD)

---

## 8. Controlled Substance & Opioid Requirements

### Opioid CME for DEA Registrants

[FACT - STATUTE] Physicians with an **Illinois Controlled Substance License** (DEA registration) must complete **1 hour of CME on safe opioid prescribing** every 6 years.

(Source: ISMS Illinois Medical License Requirement FAQs)

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] This is a conditional requirement. Physicians without DEA registration are not required to complete opioid CME (though they may choose to for professional development).

[CRITICAL GAP] The statute does not clarify:
- Whether opioid CME hours count toward the 150-hour requirement or are separate
- Whether opioid CME must be formal (counted in the 60-hour formal minimum) or can be informal
- Specific course content standards for opioid CME

---

## 9. CME Tracking & Compliance Verification

### CME Documentation Requirements

[FACT - STATUTE] Physicians must maintain documentation of CME completion and provide certificates upon request for audit or verification. 68 Ill Adm Code § 1285.110(f).

[CRITICAL GAP] Specific documentation retention requirements (e.g., 7 years, 10 years) are not detailed in statute or accessible materials.

### Audit Procedures

[FACT - STATUTE] The IDFPR conducts random audits of physicians for CME compliance. 68 Ill Adm Code § 1285.110.

[CRITICAL GAP] The percentage or frequency of audits is not published in statute or accessible materials.

---

## 10. Renewal Procedures & Fees

### Standard Renewal Process

[FACT - STATUTE] Physicians renew through the Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation (IDFPR) online portal at https://online-dfpr.micropact.com/

[FACT - BOARD] Renewal submission window: 2-3 months before July 31 expiration date.

### Renewal Fees

[CRITICAL GAP] The specific renewal fee amount is not published in statute or the accessible board materials reviewed. This should be obtained from IDFPR directly or through the renewal portal.

### Grace Period & Late Renewal

[CRITICAL GAP] Grace period mechanics and late fees are not documented in statute or accessible materials. This should be clarified with IDFPR.

### Cross-Source Congruency

**Verification Against FSMB Data:**
- FSMB reports: "150 hrs/3yr, 60 hrs Category 1" ✅ **MATCHES statute** (though statute uses "formal" not "Category 1")
- FSMB reports: "Sexual harassment (1 hr), implicit bias (1 hr) per cycle" ✅ **MATCHES statute**
- FSMB reports: "Six-year cycle topics: opioids, cultural competency, dementia (1 hr each)" ✅ **MATCHES statute**
- FSMB reports: "CME from other states/board cert counts" ✅ **MATCHES statute** (specialty board programs count)
- FSMB reports: "Multiple effective dates 2023-2026" ✅ **MATCHES statute**

**Congruency Assessment:** FSMB data aligns with Illinois statute. No significant conflicts identified.

2. **Pending maternal health equity requirement** (unfinalized as of Jan 2, 2026)
3. **Published information gaps** (fees, grace periods, audit procedures)
4. **Absence of board certification exemption** (unlike other states)

## Conclusion

Illinois MD license renewal requirements are **highly complex** (TIER 3) with overlapping 3-year and 6-year CME sub-cycles, multiple mandatory topics with staggered effective dates, and pending regulatory changes.

**Core Requirements Summary:**
- 150 hours triennial CME (60 formal, max 90 informal)
- Mandatory per-cycle topics: Sexual harassment (1 hr), implicit bias (1 hr)
- Mandatory 6-year sub-cycle topics: Opioids (DEA only, 1 hr), cultural competency (1 hr), dementia (1 hr)
- No board certification exemption found
- First-time renewal exempt from CME
- Renewal deadline: July 31 every 3 years
- Pending: Maternal health equity CME (effective date TBD, potentially July 1, 2026)

**Key Complexity Factors:**
1. 3-year renewal cycle (longer than most states) = 150 hours (vs. 40-50 in many states)
2. 6-year sub-cycle topics create variable requirements year-to-year
3. Multiple mandatory topics with different effective dates (2023-2026 transition period)
4. Formal/informal balance requirement (60 formal, max 90 informal)
5. Pending maternal health equity requirement adds future complexity

**For Physician Compliance:** Track both 3-year and 6-year cycles carefully. Complete sexual harassment and implicit bias training at each 3-year renewal. Plan ahead for 6-year topic completion (cultural competency, dementia, opioids). Monitor IDFPR website for maternal health equity CME details (expected clarification mid-2026).

**For Rules Engine Implementation:** The primary implementation challenge is the 6-year sub-cycle complexity, which requires tracking multiple overlapping CME cycles and calculating variable requirements based on physician license date and prior completion dates. The pending maternal health equity requirement will require updates once finalized.
