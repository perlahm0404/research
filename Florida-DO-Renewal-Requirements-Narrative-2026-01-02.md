# Florida DO License Renewal Requirements - Comprehensive Research

## Executive Summary

The Florida Board of Osteopathic Medicine regulates osteopathic physicians (DOs) in Florida. Florida is a **TIER 2 SPLIT-BOARD STATE** with separate MD and DO regulatory boards and different CME requirements.

**Key Requirements:**

**CME Requirement:**
- **Total Hours:** 40 hours every 2 years (biennial renewal cycle)
  - **AOA Category 1-A Minimum:** 20 hours (osteopathic medicine practice under osteopathic auspices)
  - **Remaining 20 hours:** May be AMA or AOA credits

## 1. Board Information & Regulatory Authority

### Official Board Information

**[FACT - BOARD]** The Florida Board of Osteopathic Medicine is the official regulatory agency for osteopathic physicians (DOs) in Florida.

**Contact Information:**
- **Website:** https://floridasosteopathicmedicine.gov
- **Phone:** (850) 488-0595
- **Renewal Portal:** https://flhealthsource.gov
- **Help Center:** https://floridasosteopathicmedicine.gov/help-center/

**Source:** https://floridasosteopathicmedicine.gov

### Statutory Authority

**[FACT - STATUTE]** The Florida Board of Osteopathic Medicine operates under **Florida Statute Chapter 459** (Osteopathic Medicine), completely separate from Chapter 458 which governs allopathic physicians.

**[FACT - STATUTE]** CME requirements are codified in **Fla. Stat. § 459.0076** (Continuing education requirements).

**[FACT - ADMIN_CODE]** Implementation details are in **Florida Administrative Code Rule 64B15-13** (Continuing Medical Education).

**Source:**
- https://flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2024/Chapter459/All
- https://flrules.org/gateway/Division.asp?DivID=306

### Split-Board Context

**[FACT - STATE STRUCTURE]** Florida maintains **completely separate regulatory boards** for MD and DO physicians:
- **Florida Board of Medicine (FL-M):** Regulates allopathic physicians (MDs) under Chapter 458
- **Florida Board of Osteopathic Medicine (FL-O):** Regulates osteopathic physicians (DOs) under Chapter 459

**[CRITICAL DISTINCTION]** This split-board structure results in:
- Different CME total hours (DO: 40 hrs, MD: 38 hrs)
- Different category requirements (DO: 20 hrs AOA 1-A, MD: all AMA Cat 1)
- Different renewal dates (DO: March 31 fixed, MD: birthday)
- Different mandatory topics (DO: 5 hrs specific, MD: different structure)

---

## 2. CME REQUIREMENT - TOTAL HOURS & CYCLE

### Total Hour Requirement

**[FACT - ADMIN_CODE]** Florida-licensed osteopathic physicians must complete **40 credit hours of continuing medical education** during the **biennial renewal period** (2-year cycle).

**Citation:** Rule 64B15-13.001, F.A.C.

**Source:**
- https://content.cmepassport.org/staterequirement/florida-board-of-osteopathic-medicine-do/
- https://www.foma.org/cme-requirements
- https://floridasosteopathicmedicine.gov/renewal-cme-faqs/

**[FACT - BOARD]** The CME reporting period for osteopathic physicians runs from **April 1 (even year) through March 31 (next even year)**.

**Current Renewal Period:**
- **CME Period:** April 1, 2024 – March 31, 2026
- **Renewal Deadline:** March 31, 2026 (midnight Eastern Time)

**Next Renewal Period:**
- **CME Period:** April 1, 2026 – March 31, 2028
- **Renewal Deadline:** March 31, 2028

**Source:** https://www.foma.org/cme-requirements

### Category Requirements

**[FACT - ADMIN_CODE]** Of the 40 total hours:
- **Minimum 20 hours** must be **AOA Category 1-A** (osteopathic medicine practice under osteopathic auspices)
- **Remaining 20 hours** may be either **AMA** or **AOA** credits
- **Maximum 8 hours** per biennium may be **home study/distance learning**

**Citation:** Rule 64B15-13.001, F.A.C.

**Source:**
- https://content.cmepassport.org/staterequirement/florida-board-of-osteopathic-medicine-do/
- https://www.foma.org/cme-requirements

**AOA Category 1-A Definition:**
**[FACT - BOARD]** AOA Category 1-A credits must focus on **"general osteopathic medicine practice under osteopathic auspices"**, meaning:
- Osteopathic principles and practice
- Osteopathic manipulative treatment (OMT)
- Programs sponsored by AOA-accredited institutions
- Osteopathic-focused content delivered by osteopathic organizations

**[CRITICAL DIFFERENCE FROM MD]** MD physicians (Board of Medicine) require all 38 hours to be AMA Category 1 only - no osteopathic requirement and no home study allowed. DO physicians have both osteopathic-specific minimums and home study flexibility.

**Source:** Cross-referenced with Florida-MD-Renewal-Requirements-Narrative-2026-01-02.md

### Home Study / Distance Learning

**[FACT - BOARD]** During the April 1, 2024 – March 31, 2026 renewal period, **distance learning satisfies all requirements**, with a maximum of **8 hours** per biennium countable.

**Source:** https://www.foma.org/cme-requirements

**[INFERENCE - HIGH]** This likely reflects pandemic-era accommodations that may have been extended or made permanent, allowing virtual CME to satisfy osteopathic education requirements.

---

## 3. MANDATORY CME TOPICS - DO-SPECIFIC (5 Hours)

### DO-Specific Mandatory Topics Overview

**[FACT - BOARD]** Florida osteopathic physicians must complete **5 specific mandatory hours** within the 40-hour total requirement:

| Topic | Hours | Frequency |
|-------|-------|-----------|
| Risk Management | 1 hour | Every biennial cycle |
| Florida Laws and Rules | 1 hour | Every biennial cycle |
| Controlled Substances | 1 hour | Every biennial cycle |
| Medical Error Prevention | 2 hours | Every biennial cycle |
| **TOTAL DO-SPECIFIC** | **5 hours** | **Every 2 years** |

**Source:**
- https://content.cmepassport.org/staterequirement/florida-board-of-osteopathic-medicine-do/
- https://www.foma.org/cme-requirements

**[IMPORTANT]** These 5 hours are **in addition to** the shared mandatory topics (HIV/AIDS, domestic violence) that both MD and DO physicians must complete.

### Topic 1: Risk Management (1 Hour Biennial)

**[FACT - BOARD]** Osteopathic physicians must complete **1 hour on risk management** every biennial renewal cycle.

**Source:** https://content.cmepassport.org/staterequirement/florida-board-of-osteopathic-medicine-do/

**[CRITICAL GAP]** Specific content requirements for risk management CME are not detailed in accessible materials (e.g., must cover malpractice prevention, patient safety, communication skills, etc.).

### Topic 2: Florida Laws and Rules (1 Hour Biennial)

**[FACT - BOARD]** Osteopathic physicians must complete **1 hour on Florida laws and rules** (including professional and medical ethics) every biennial renewal cycle.

**Source:**
- https://content.cmepassport.org/staterequirement/florida-board-of-osteopathic-medicine-do/
- https://www.foma.org/cme-requirements

**[INFERENCE - MEDIUM]** This requirement likely covers:
- Florida medical practice act (Chapter 459)
- Board rules and regulations
- Professional ethics and conduct
- Scope of practice boundaries
- Reporting requirements

### Topic 3: Controlled Substances (1 Hour Biennial + 2 Hours for DEA Prescribers)

**[FACT - BOARD]** Osteopathic physicians must complete **1 hour on controlled substances regulations** every biennial renewal cycle.

**[FACT - BOARD]** Physicians who are **DEA-registered prescribers** must complete an **additional 2 hours on controlled substance prescribing (opioids)** per biennial cycle, for a total of **3 hours** controlled substance CME.

**Citation:** Rule 64B15-13.001, F.A.C.

**Source:**
- https://content.cmepassport.org/staterequirement/florida-board-of-osteopathic-medicine-do/
- https://www.foma.org/cme-requirements

**Breakdown for DEA Prescribers:**
- 1 hour: Controlled substance regulations (all DOs)
- 2 hours: Controlled substance prescribing practices/opioids (DEA-registered only)
- **Total: 3 hours** for DEA-registered osteopathic physicians

**[INFERENCE - HIGH]** Content likely includes:
- Florida PDMP (E-FORCSE) usage
- CDC opioid prescribing guidelines
- Identifying drug-seeking behavior
- Safe prescribing practices
- Opioid addiction risks

### Topic 4: Medical Error Prevention (2 Hours Biennial)

**[FACT - BOARD]** Osteopathic physicians must complete **2 hours of Prevention of Medical Errors** education every biennial renewal cycle.

**Source:**
- https://content.cmepassport.org/staterequirement/florida-board-of-osteopathic-medicine-do/
- https://www.foma.org/cme-requirements

**[COMPARISON WITH MD]** MD physicians have a **flexible medical errors requirement**:
- **Option 1:** 2 hours one-time (never repeated)
- **Option 2:** 1 hour every 3rd biennial renewal

**DO physicians have a simpler, stricter requirement:** 2 hours every biennial cycle (no flexibility).

**[INFERENCE - MEDIUM]** This difference suggests the DO board prioritizes ongoing medical error education rather than the one-time or periodic approach used by the MD board.

---

## 4. MANDATORY CME TOPICS - SHARED WITH MD

### Shared Topic 1: HIV/AIDS Education (1 Hour - First Renewal Only)

**[FACT - STATUTE]** All Florida health care practitioners, including DO physicians, must complete **1 hour of HIV/AIDS education** for first renewal.

**Citation:** Fla. Stat. § 456.013 (General licensing provisions; education on HIV/AIDS and domestic violence)

**Frequency:** **First renewal only** (one-time requirement)

**Source:**
- https://content.cmepassport.org/staterequirement/florida-board-of-osteopathic-medicine-do/
- https://www.foma.org/cme-requirements

**[FACT - BOARD]** First-time licensees must complete this 1 hour before their initial renewal concludes (by March 31 of first renewal cycle).

**[COMPARISON WITH MD]** MD physicians have the **same requirement** (1 hr HIV/AIDS first renewal only), demonstrating this is a statewide health professional mandate, not board-specific.

### Shared Topic 2: Domestic Violence (2 Hours Every 3rd Renewal)

**[FACT - STATUTE]** All Florida health care practitioners must complete **2 hours of domestic violence education** every **third biennial renewal cycle**.

**Citation:** Fla. Stat. § 456.013

**Frequency:** Every 3rd renewal (e.g., renewals 3, 6, 9, 12, etc.)

**Source:**
- https://content.cmepassport.org/staterequirement/florida-board-of-osteopathic-medicine-do/
- https://www.foma.org/cme-requirements

**[FACT - BOARD]** This 2-hour course may be completed **through distance learning**.

**[COMPARISON WITH MD]** MD physicians have the **identical requirement** (2 hrs domestic violence every 3rd renewal), confirming this is a statewide mandate applying equally to both boards.

**[CRITICAL GAP]** How the "every 3rd renewal" cycle is tracked for physicians licensed mid-cycle or with gaps in licensure is not documented. Does the 3rd renewal count from initial licensure or from a fixed calendar starting point?

---

## 5. RENEWAL CYCLE & DEADLINES

### Biennial Renewal Structure

**[FACT - BOARD]** Osteopathic physician licenses in Florida renew **biennially** (every 2 years) with a **fixed deadline of March 31** in **even-numbered years**.

**Renewal Years:** 2024, 2026, 2028, 2030, etc. (all even years)

**Source:**
- https://floridasosteopathicmedicine.gov/
- https://www.foma.org/cme-requirements

**[FACT - BOARD]** The current renewal cycle:
- **CME Period:** April 1, 2024 – March 31, 2026
- **License Expiration:** Midnight, Eastern Time, March 31, 2026

**[CRITICAL DIFFERENCE FROM MD]** DO physicians renew on a **fixed date (March 31 even years)** for ALL licensees, while MD physicians renew on their **individual birthday** biennial. This is a significant administrative difference between the two boards.

### CME Period vs. Renewal Date

**[FACT - BOARD]** The CME reporting period and license expiration are aligned:
- **CME must be completed:** April 1 (even year) through March 31 (next even year)
- **License expires:** March 31 of the next even year at midnight

**Example:**
- Current cycle: April 1, 2024 – March 31, 2026
- CME must be completed by: March 31, 2026
- License expires: Midnight Eastern Time, March 31, 2026
- Renewal must be submitted: Before midnight March 31, 2026

**Source:** https://www.foma.org/cme-requirements

---

## 6. RENEWAL FEES & PAYMENTS

### Active License Renewal Fee

**[FACT - ADMIN_CODE]** The **biennial renewal fee** for an **active** osteopathic physician license is **$429**.

**Citation:** Rule 64B15-10.002, F.A.C.

**Source:** Via search results referencing Florida administrative code fee schedules

**[COMPARISON WITH MD]** MD physician renewal fee is **$400** (active), making DO renewal **$29 more expensive** per biennial cycle.

### Inactive License Renewal Fee

**[FACT - ADMIN_CODE]** The **biennial renewal fee** for an **inactive** osteopathic physician license is **$229**.

**Source:** Via search results referencing Florida administrative code fee schedules

**[FACT - BOARD]** Physicians with inactive licenses:
- Are exempt from CME requirements
- Cannot practice medicine in Florida
- Must apply for active status to return to practice

**[CRITICAL GAP]** Requirements for reactivating an inactive license (e.g., CME hours needed, fees, processing time) are not documented in accessible materials.

### Fee Waiver for Volunteer Services

**[FACT - STATUTE]** Physicians may be eligible for a **waiver of biennial renewal fees** if they:
- Volunteer services in **public schools** for a minimum of **80 hours per year**, OR
- If **retired**, volunteer at least **400 hours per year**

**Source:** Via search results (Fla. Stat. § 456.036)

**[CRITICAL GAP]** Application procedures and eligibility verification requirements for fee waivers are not detailed in accessible materials.

### FLHealthSource Online Renewal

**[FACT - BOARD]** Florida uses the **FLHealthSource** online portal for license renewal at **https://flhealthsource.gov**.

**Source:**
- https://flhealthsource.gov
- https://floridasosteopathicmedicine.gov/

**Portal Features:**
- Online license renewal
- CME verification (automatic via CE Broker integration)
- License verification
- Fee payment (credit/debit card, electronic check)
- Application status tracking

---

## 7. GRACE PERIOD, DELINQUENT STATUS & LATE FEES

### Delinquent Status Definition

**[FACT - STATUTE]** If a licensee fails to renew before the license expires (midnight March 31), the license **immediately enters delinquent status** in the license cycle following expiration.

**Citation:** Fla. Stat. § 456.036 (Licenses; active and inactive status; delinquency)

**Source:** https://www.lawserver.com/law/state/florida/statutes/florida_statutes_456-036

**[FACT - STATUTE]** A delinquent licensee must **affirmatively apply with a complete application** for active or inactive status **during the licensure cycle in which the licensee becomes delinquent**.

**Example Timeline:**
- **March 31, 2026 (11:59 PM):** License expires
- **April 1, 2026:** License enters delinquent status
- **Delinquent Window:** April 1, 2026 – March 31, 2027 (must renew during this period)
- **April 1, 2027:** License becomes **null and void** if still not renewed

### Null & Void Status

**[FACT - STATUTE]** Failure by a delinquent licensee to become active or inactive **before the expiration of the current licensure cycle** renders the license **null and void without any further action** by the board or the department.

**Source:** Fla. Stat. § 456.036

**[CRITICAL DISTINCTION]** Florida uses a "null and void" system rather than "lapsed" or "suspended":
- **Delinquent:** License expired but can be renewed within current cycle (with penalty)
- **Null & Void:** License expired for full 2-year cycle, cannot be renewed - must apply for new license

**[INFERENCE - HIGH]** "Null and void" status likely requires a complete new licensure application, not just late renewal with fees. This is a more severe consequence than most states' "lapsed" license reinstatement procedures.

### Delinquency Fee (Late Renewal Penalty)

**[FACT - STATUTE]** Each board shall by rule impose an **additional delinquency fee**, not to exceed the biennial renewal fee for an active status license, on a delinquent licensee when such licensee applies for active or inactive status.

**Citation:** Fla. Stat. § 456.036

**[FACT - ADMIN_CODE]** If renewing the license after the expiration date with a status of 'Clear/Active' or 'Clear/Inactive', a **delinquency fee** will be assessed **in addition to renewal fees**.

**Source:** Via search results (Florida administrative code summaries)

**Maximum Delinquency Fee:** Up to **$429** (the active renewal fee amount)

**[CRITICAL GAP]** The **exact delinquency fee amount** is not specified in accessible materials. It could range from a nominal amount to the full $429 maximum. Physicians should contact the board at (850) 488-0595 to confirm the current delinquency fee.

**Total Cost for Delinquent Renewal:**
- Active renewal fee: $429
- Delinquency fee: Up to $429 (amount unclear)
- **Potential total:** $429 - $858

### No Grace Period for Practice

**[FACT - STATUTE]** It is **illegal to practice medicine with an expired license** in Florida.

**[INFERENCE - HIGH]** While the "delinquent" status provides a window to renew with penalty (April 1 year 1 – March 31 year 2), physicians **cannot legally practice** during this delinquent period. The license is not valid for practice even though renewal is still possible.

---

## 8. CME TRACKING & VERIFICATION - CE BROKER SYSTEM

### CE Broker Electronic Tracking

**[FACT - BOARD]** Florida Department of Health verifies licensee compliance with continuing education requirements at the time of licensure renewal through the **electronic tracking system, powered by CE Broker**.

**Source:** https://floridasosteopathicmedicine.gov/renewal-cme-faqs/

**[FACT - BOARD]** Licensees must **report continuing education course completion to CE Broker** before license renewal.

**How CE Broker Works:**
1. Physician completes CME course from approved provider
2. Provider reports course completion directly to CE Broker (if integrated)
3. Physician logs into CE Broker to verify hours recorded
4. At renewal, FLHealthSource pulls CME data from CE Broker automatically
5. If requirements met, renewal processed; if not, renewal blocked until compliant

**CE Broker Website:** https://www.cebroker.com

### CME Provider Reporting

**[FACT - BOARD]** Many CME providers report course completions **automatically** to CE Broker, eliminating the need for physicians to manually upload certificates.

**[FACT - BOARD]** The Florida Osteopathic Medical Association (FOMA) reports CME hours to both **CE Broker** and the **AOA** through their meetings and online courses.

**Source:** https://www.foma.org/cme-requirements

**[INFERENCE - HIGH]** Physicians should verify that chosen CME providers are CE Broker-integrated to ensure automatic reporting. Non-integrated providers may require manual certificate uploads.

### Manual CME Reporting

**[CRITICAL GAP]** The process for manually uploading CME certificates to CE Broker (for non-integrated providers) is not detailed in accessible board materials. Physicians likely log into CE Broker and upload PDF certificates, but exact procedures are not documented.

### CME Completed Prior to Licensure

**[FACT - ADMIN_CODE]** CME completed **prior to licensure** can count towards biennial renewal if it meets the requirements as outlined by rule.

**Citation:** Rule 64B15-13.001(4)(e), F.A.C.

**Source:** https://floridasosteopathicmedicine.gov/help-center/ (FAQ)

**[INFERENCE - MEDIUM]** Physicians who complete CME during application/licensure process (e.g., between application submission and license issuance) may apply those hours toward first renewal if they fall within the first renewal cycle dates (April 1 even year – March 31 next even year).

---

## 9. CME CREDIT ALTERNATIVES & SPECIAL PROVISIONS

### Residency/Fellowship CME Credit

**[FACT - ADMIN_CODE]** Rule 64B15-13.001(4)(e), F.A.C., allows for **ten (10) general CME credit hours** to be awarded for successful completion of each **six (6) month training program period** (residency, fellowship, or internship).

**Source:** https://floridasosteopathicmedicine.gov/help-center/ (FAQ)

**Calculation Example:**
- 1 year (12 months) of residency = 2 six-month periods = **20 CME hours**
- 2 years (24 months) of residency = 4 six-month periods = **40 CME hours** (satisfies full biennial requirement)

**[FACT - BOARD]** Physicians actively in a fellowship, residency, or internship program **do not have to complete CMEs for renewal** during their training period.

**Source:** https://floridasosteopathicmedicine.gov/help-center/ (FAQ: "I am in a fellowship, residency, and/or internship program. Do I have to complete CMEs for renewal?")

**[INFERENCE - HIGH]** Residents and fellows are exempt from CME requirements while in active training, recognizing that training itself constitutes ongoing medical education.

### Volunteer Service CME Credit

**[FACT - ADMIN_CODE]** Rule 64B15-13.005 allows up to **ten (10) CME hours per biennium** by performing **pro bono medical services** to:
- The indigent
- Underserved populations
- Areas of critical need within the state where the licensee practices

**Source:** https://floridasosteopathicmedicine.gov/help-center/ (FAQ: "Can I receive CME credit for volunteer hours?")

**[CRITICAL GAP]** Requirements for documenting and verifying volunteer service hours are not detailed in accessible materials. Physicians should contact the board to confirm documentation standards.

---

## 10. EXEMPTIONS & SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES

### Board Certification Exemptions

**[CRITICAL GAP - HIGH PRIORITY]** The Florida Board of Osteopathic Medicine website does not document whether **osteopathic board certification** (e.g., AOA-BOS certification or Maintenance of Certification) provides:
- Full or partial exemption from the 40-hour CME requirement
- CME credit toward the 40-hour requirement
- Exemption from CME audits or CE Broker reporting
- Any other benefits

**[COMPARISON WITH MD BOARD]** The MD board documentation also does not clearly specify board certification CME benefits, suggesting neither Florida board may offer board certification exemptions (unlike some other states that credit 50-100 hours for active certification).

**Recommendation:** Board-certified osteopathic physicians should contact the Board at (850) 488-0595 to clarify whether AOA-BOS certification provides CME benefits in Florida.

### Military Service

**[CRITICAL GAP]** No documentation found regarding:
- Whether active duty military physicians are exempt from CME requirements during deployment
- Whether military physicians have extended renewal timelines
- Whether military CME (completed through DoD/VA systems) counts toward Florida requirements
- Whether spouses of military members receive licensing accommodations

### Hardship Waivers

**[CRITICAL GAP]** The Board website does not document:
- Criteria for hardship waivers or CME requirement reductions
- Application procedures for medical disability affecting ability to complete CME
- Emergency or disaster-related extensions (e.g., pandemic, natural disaster)

**[INFERENCE - LOW]** The Board likely has statutory authority to grant waivers in extraordinary circumstances (similar to MD board), but criteria and procedures are not published in accessible format.

## 11. STATE-SPECIFIC CME FEATURES

### CE Broker Integration (Florida-Specific)

**[FACT - BOARD]** Florida is one of the few states with **mandatory electronic CME tracking** through CE Broker for all health care practitioners.

**Source:** https://www.cebroker.com

**[INFERENCE - HIGH]** This integration creates efficiency and reduces fraud/non-compliance by automating CME verification at renewal. Physicians cannot complete renewal without CE Broker verification.

### 3rd Renewal Cycle Tracking (Florida-Specific)

**[FACT - STATUTE]** The domestic violence 2-hour requirement repeats **every 3rd biennial renewal**, creating a 6-year sub-cycle.

**[CRITICAL GAP]** How the board tracks the "3rd renewal" for each individual physician is not documented. Possible systems:
- Fixed calendar cycle (e.g., all physicians' 3rd renewal = 2024, 2030, 2036...)
- Individual tracking from initial licensure date (1st, 2nd, 3rd renewals counted from initial license)
- Birthday-based tracking (unlikely since DO renewal is March 31 fixed)

**Recommendation:** Physicians should contact the board to clarify how their personal "3rd renewal" is determined to ensure domestic violence CME compliance.

### Medical Errors Flexibility Difference (Florida-Specific)

**[COMPARISON]** Florida creates a split in medical errors requirements between boards:
- **MD Board (FBM):** 2 hrs one-time OR 1 hr every 3rd renewal (physician choice)
- **DO Board (FBOM):** 2 hrs every biennial renewal (no flexibility)

**[INFERENCE - MEDIUM]** This reflects different board philosophies:
- MD board: One-time comprehensive training sufficient
- DO board: Ongoing reinforcement every 2 years necessary

### Key Takeaways from Comparison

**Material Differences:**
1. **Total Hours:** DO 40 hrs vs MD 38 hrs (+2 hrs)
2. **Category Requirements:** DO requires 20 hrs AOA 1-A osteopathic; MD requires all AMA Category 1
3. **DO-Specific Mandatory Topics:** DO has 5 hrs DO-only topics (risk mgmt, FL laws, controlled substances, medical errors 2 hrs); MD does not
4. **Medical Errors Structure:** DO requires 2 hrs biennial (ongoing); MD offers one-time or every-3rd-renewal flexibility
5. **Home Study:** DO allows 8 hrs; MD does not allow home study
6. **Renewal Date:** DO fixed March 31; MD individual birthday
7. **Renewal Fee:** DO $429 vs MD $400 (+$29)
8. **Grace Period Structure:** DO uses delinquent cycle; MD uses 60-day grace period

**Similarities:**
- CE Broker tracking system
- FLHealthSource renewal portal
- HIV/AIDS requirement (1 hr first renewal)
- Domestic violence requirement (2 hrs every 3rd renewal)
- Both regulated by Florida Department of Health

**Result:** Florida MD and DO physicians have significantly different CME compliance paths despite both being regulated by the state. DO physicians have higher total hours, more mandatory topics, and osteopathic-specific education requirements.

## 14. CRITICAL GAPS & LIMITATIONS

### Critical Gaps Identified During Research

**[CRITICAL GAP #1] Exact Delinquency Fee Amount**
- **What's Missing:** The specific dollar amount of the delinquency fee for late renewal
- **Why It Matters:** Physicians need accurate cost estimates for late renewal
- **Search Attempts:** Searched § 456.036, Rule 64B15-10.002 - statute allows "up to $429" but exact amount not specified
- **Impact:** MEDIUM - affects financial planning for late renewal
- **Recommendation:** Contact Board at (850) 488-0595 to confirm current delinquency fee

**[CRITICAL GAP #2] Board Certification Exemption Policy**
- **What's Missing:** Whether AOA-BOS board certification or MOC provides CME credit or exemptions
- **Why It Matters:** Board-certified DOs need to know if certification reduces CME burden
- **Search Attempts:** Searched board website, Florida statutes, admin code - no documentation found
- **Impact:** HIGH for board-certified physicians
- **Recommendation:** Contact Board at (850) 488-0595

**[CRITICAL GAP #3] 3rd Renewal Cycle Tracking Mechanics**
- **What's Missing:** How the "every 3rd biennial renewal" domestic violence requirement is tracked per individual physician
- **Why It Matters:** Physicians need to know which renewal cycle is their "3rd" to ensure compliance
- **Search Attempts:** Searched board FAQs, statutes - tracking method not documented
- **Impact:** MEDIUM - risk of missing required domestic violence CME
- **Recommendation:** Contact Board to clarify personal 3rd renewal cycle

**[CRITICAL GAP #4] CME Audit Procedures**
- **What's Missing:** Audit frequency, selection criteria, response timeline, penalties for non-compliance
- **Why It Matters:** Physicians need to understand audit risk and compliance obligations
- **Search Attempts:** Searched board website - no detailed audit procedures found
- **Impact:** MEDIUM - affects compliance preparation
- **Recommendation:** Contact Board for audit details

**[CRITICAL GAP #5] CME Documentation Retention Period**
- **What's Missing:** How long physicians must retain CME certificates
- **Why It Matters:** Physicians need to know retention requirements to avoid audit non-compliance
- **Search Attempts:** Searched board website, admin code - not specified
- **Impact:** MEDIUM - risk of audit failure if documentation discarded
- **Recommendation:** Assume 4 years minimum (standard practice) and contact Board to confirm

**[CRITICAL GAP #6] Inactive License Reactivation Requirements**
- **What's Missing:** CME hours required, fees, processing time to reactivate inactive license to active
- **Why It Matters:** Physicians returning to practice need reactivation pathway
- **Search Attempts:** Searched board website - general mention but no specifics
- **Impact:** MEDIUM for physicians with inactive status
- **Recommendation:** Contact Board before attempting reactivation

**[CRITICAL GAP #7] New Licensee Pro-Rata CME**
- **What's Missing:** Whether newly licensed physicians licensed mid-cycle have reduced CME requirements for first renewal
- **Why It Matters:** New physicians need to know first renewal compliance requirements
- **Search Attempts:** Searched board FAQs - residency credit documented but not new licensee pro-rata
- **Impact:** MEDIUM for new licensees
- **Recommendation:** Contact Board before first renewal if licensed mid-cycle

**[CRITICAL GAP #8] Null & Void License Reinstatement**
- **What's Missing:** Process for reinstating a license that became "null and void" after missing delinquent renewal window
- **Why It Matters:** Physicians with null status need to know if reinstatement is possible or new application required
- **Search Attempts:** Searched statutes - "null and void" defined but reinstatement process not documented
- **Impact:** HIGH when applicable (low frequency but critical for affected physicians)
- **Recommendation:** Contact Board immediately if license has entered null status

**[CRITICAL GAP #9] Military Service Exemptions**
- **What's Missing:** CME exemptions, renewal extensions, or accommodations for active duty military physicians
- **Why It Matters:** Military physicians need to know deployment accommodation policies
- **Search Attempts:** Searched board website, Florida military accommodation statutes - no DO-specific information found
- **Impact:** MEDIUM for military physicians
- **Recommendation:** Military physicians should contact Board regarding service accommodations

**[CRITICAL GAP #10] Volunteer Service CME Documentation**
- **What's Missing:** How to document and verify pro bono service hours for 10-hour CME credit
- **Why It Matters:** Physicians providing volunteer care need to know documentation standards
- **Search Attempts:** Rule 64B15-13.005 cited but implementation details not accessible
- **Impact:** LOW-MEDIUM (rarely used)
- **Recommendation:** Contact Board for volunteer CME documentation requirements

### Research Limitations

**Florida Administrative Code Access:** Full Florida Administrative Code (Rule 64B15-13) not fully accessible online without specialized legal database subscription. Specific CME implementation details, audit procedures, and fee calculations may be in regulations not easily accessible.

**CE Broker Procedures:** The exact procedures for manually uploading CME certificates to CE Broker (for non-integrated providers) are not documented on the board website. Physicians likely access CE Broker directly but specific steps unknown.

**Federal vs. State Integration:** Unclear how federal MATE Act 8-hour opioid training requirement integrates with Florida's DO-specific controlled substance CME (1 hr + 2 hrs for DEA prescribers). Physicians should track both independently.

**Historical Context:** Some accommodations (e.g., distance learning satisfying all requirements during 2024-2026 cycle) may be pandemic-related temporary measures. Whether these are permanent policy changes is not confirmed.

### Verification Recommendations

Physicians should contact the Florida Board of Osteopathic Medicine at **(850) 488-0595** or visit **https://floridasosteopathicmedicine.gov/help-center/** to clarify:
1. Exact delinquency fee amount for late renewal
2. Board certification exemption or CME credit policies for AOA-BOS certification
3. How the "3rd renewal" domestic violence cycle is tracked for individual physicians
4. CME audit frequency, selection, and response procedures
5. CME documentation retention period
6. Inactive license reactivation requirements (CME, fees, timeline)
7. New licensee pro-rata CME requirements for first renewal
8. Null & void license reinstatement process
9. Military service CME exemptions or accommodations
10. Volunteer service CME credit documentation standards
