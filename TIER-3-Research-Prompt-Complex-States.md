# TIER 3 Research Prompt - Complex & Specialized States
**Version:** 1.0
**Created:** 2026-01-02
**Target Completion Time:** 10-15 hours per state
**License Types:** MD primary (DO if split-board)

---

## OVERVIEW

You are researching a **complex state** with specialized requirements, unique mandates, or challenging regulatory contexts.

**What makes Tier 3 complex:**
- Unique state-specific mandates (medical marijuana, jurisprudence exams, etc.)
- Multiple specialized CME topics (more than Tier 1's typical 2-4)
- Flexible or variable CME requirements (hours vary by practice area/specialty)
- High-burden controlled substance regulations
- Complexity in reinstatement or audit procedures
- May be split-board (research separately for MD and DO)

**Estimated Tier 3 States (30+):**
IL, MI-O, NC, NJ, NY, PR, TX, WA, WV + others with complex requirements

---

## CRITICAL DIFFERENCES FROM TIER 1 & 2

### Tier 3 Requires Detective Work

Unlike Tier 1 (straightforward) and Tier 2 (split boards), Tier 3 requires:

1. **Deep statutory research** - Find all CME-related sections (not just one)
2. **Multiple specialized topics** - 5+ mandatory CME topics
3. **Specialty-specific requirements** - Different CME for different practice areas
4. **Administrative complexity** - Complex audit procedures, conditional exemptions
5. **State-specific context** - Medical marijuana laws, jurisprudence exams, etc.

### Time Investment is Higher

- Tier 1: 4-6 hours
- Tier 2: 10-14 hours (dual documents)
- **Tier 3: 10-15 hours (single state, high complexity)**

## EXAMPLE TIER 3 COMPLEXITY

### Illinois Example (High Complexity)

From FSMB document:
```
150 hours every 3 years; 60 hours must be Category 1.

During each three-year cycle, physicians must complete:
- One (1) CME hour on sexual harassment prevention
- One (1) CME hour on implicit bias
Every six years, physicians must complete one (1) CME hour on each of:
- Opioids
- Cultural competency
- Dementia

CME used by physicians as a requirement for licensure in another state
count towards the CME requirement.

Additionally, physicians are required to complete one hour of continuing
education specific to sexual harassment prevention.

Beginning January 1, 2023, a health care professional who has continuing
education requirements must complete at least a one-hour course in training
on the diagnosis, treatment, and care of individuals with Alzheimer's disease
and other dementias.

Beginning January 1, 2023, a health care professional who has continuing
education requirements must complete at least a one-hour course in training
on implicit bias awareness.

Beginning July 1, 2026, health care professionals who provide maternal health
care services to complete a one hour implicit bias training course...

Beginning July 1, 2026, the Medical Board is required to accept simulation
training by an approved sponsor as CME.
```

**Complexity Issues:**
1. Six-year cycle (different from 3-year reporting)
2. Multiple one-time requirements (dementia, sexual harassment)
3. Specialty-specific (maternal health care)
4. Different effective dates for different requirements
5. Recent regulatory changes (2025-2026)

### Texas Example (Flexible Requirements)

From FSMB document:
```
48 hours every 2 years; 24 must be AMA Category 1 or AOA Category 1A;
2 of those 24 hours must be on medical ethics and/or professional responsibility
including courses in risk management, domestic abuse or child abuse;
a human trafficking prevention course must be completed as part of the
medical ethics and/or professional responsibility requirement;
the remaining 24 hours may be composed of informal self-study, attendance at
hospital lectures, grand rounds, or case conferences not approved for formal CME.

For licensees with direct patient care practice, no less than 2 hours of CME
regarding safe and effective pain management related to the prescription of
opioids and other controlled substances must be completed in each of the first
two renewal periods following initial licensure, and every eight years thereafter.

For licensees practicing in pain management clinics, licensees must complete
10 hours of CME annually in pain management.

Physicians are exempted from CME requirements if in the preceding 36 months
the physician becomes board certified or recertified by a specialty board
approved by the American Board of Medical Specialties (ABMS).

Effective September 1, 2025, the Medical Board must establish rules requiring
licensees to complete a Board-determined number of hours on nutrition training
based on the guidelines of the Texas Nutrition Advisory Committee.
```

**Complexity Issues:**
1. Mixed formal/informal CME allowed
2. Specialty-specific pain management requirement
3. Initial licensure different from ongoing (2 periods vs. every 8 years)
4. Pending regulatory change (nutrition training, effective Sept 2025)
5. Board certification exemption (entire requirement, not partial credit)

## RESEARCH PROCESS FOR TIER 3 (10-15 hours)

### Step 1: Identify All CME-Related Statutes (1 hour)

Most states have one main statute. Tier 3 states often have CME scattered across multiple sections.

**Search Strategy:**
1. Find medical practice act
2. Search for "continuing education" in statute
3. Search for "CME" in statute
4. Search for "educational requirements"
5. Search for "professional development"
6. Check disciplinary sections (may have requirements related to violations)

**Document:**
```
Statute Sections Found:
- § X-1: Basic renewal requirements (CME hours, cycle)
- § X-2: Controlled substance prescribing
- § X-3: Opioid-specific CME
- § X-4: Professional development options
- § X-5: Board certification exemptions
- Administrative Code § Y: Implementation details
```

---

### Step 2: Document Every Mandatory Topic (2-3 hours)

Tier 3 states often have 5+ mandatory topics. Document EACH ONE.

**For every topic found, include:**
```
**[TOPIC NAME]**

[FACT - STATUTE] [STATE] requires [X] hours of [TOPIC] CME

Citation: [Full statute section]
Source: [URL]
Quote: "[Exact text from statute]"

**Frequency:**
- [FACT] Annual? Every renewal cycle? One-time? Every X years?
- [FACT] Applies to all physicians or specific types (pain management, pediatrics, etc.)?

**Effective Date:**
- [FACT] When did this requirement begin?
- [FACT] Any recent changes?

**Waivers/Exemptions:**
- [FACT] Can this requirement be waived? Under what conditions?

**Cross-Source Validation:**
- STATUTE: Yes ✅
- FSMB: [Match/Conflict/Not mentioned]
- BOARD: [Match/Conflict/Not mentioned]
```

### Example: Illinois Topics

From statute/board regulations, you'd document:
1. **Sexual Harassment Prevention** - 1 hour per cycle (effective Jan 1, 2025)
2. **Implicit Bias** - 1 hour per cycle (effective Jan 1, 2023)
3. **Opioids** - 1 hour every 6 years (effective pending)
4. **Cultural Competency** - 1 hour every 6 years (effective pending)
5. **Dementia/Alzheimer's** - 1 hour per renewal (effective Jan 1, 2023)
6. **Maternal Health Equity** - 1 hour every 2 years (effective July 1, 2026) - SPECIALTY-SPECIFIC

---

### Step 3: Identify Specialty-Specific Requirements (1-2 hours)

Some states require different CME for different practice areas.

**Search Strategy:**
1. Look for "pain management" physicians (often 10+ hours annually)
2. Look for "pediatrics" or "child care" (child abuse requirements)
3. Look for "obstetrics/gynecology" (maternal health, reproductive health)
4. Look for "emergency medicine" (trauma, life support)
5. Look for "geriatrics" or adult populations (elder care)

**Texas Example:**
- General physicians: 48 hrs/2yr
- Pain management clinic physicians: 10 hrs/year + general requirement
- Physicians with direct patient care (prescribers): 2 hrs pain management first 2 renewals, then every 8 years

---

### Step 4: Track Effective Dates & Changes (1 hour)

Tier 3 states often have pending regulatory changes. Track them.

**Format:**
```
**Regulatory Timeline**

- [DATE] Original CME requirement established (requirement X)
- [DATE] Opioid requirement added (requirement Y)
- [DATE PAST] Implicit bias requirement effective (requirement Z)
- [DATE PENDING] Nutrition training requirement effective Sept 1, 2025 (not yet implemented)
- [DATE PENDING] Maternal health equity requirement effective July 1, 2026 (not yet implemented)

**Current Compliance Expectation:** As of [TODAY'S DATE], requirements effective
before [TODAY'S DATE] must be met at renewal. Requirements effective after [TODAY'S DATE]
are noted for future compliance calendars.
```

---

### Step 5: Controlled Substance Requirements Detail (1 hour)

For Tier 3 states with complex opioid/controlled substance rules:

**Research:**
1. DEA registration requirement
2. Opioid prescribing limit (days supply for acute pain)
3. Chronic pain documentation requirements
4. Prescription Monitoring Program (PDMP) mandatory use
5. Telemedicine opioid restrictions
6. Specific opioid CME hours required
7. Board certification in pain management (if required)

**Example: Colorado**

From FSMB:
```
Effective March 30, 2020, licensees must complete at least two hours of
training per licensing cycle related to best practices for opioid prescribing,
recognition of substance use disorders, referral of patients with substance
use disorders for treatment, and use of the Electronic Prescription Drug
Monitoring Program. Licensees who maintain a national board certification
that requires equivalent substance use prevention training, or attest that
they do not prescribe opioids, are exempted.
```

**Research Questions:**
- Is this 2 hours mandatory or only if prescribing?
- Can attestation that you don't prescribe satisfy the requirement?
- If board certified, do you automatically get exemption?

---

### Step 6: Conditional Exemptions & Board Certification (1-2 hours)

Tier 3 states often have complex exemption rules.

**Example: Texas**
```
"Physicians are exempted from CME requirements if in the preceding 36 months
the physician becomes board certified or recertified by a specialty board
approved by the American Board of Medical Specialties (ABMS)"
```

**Research Questions:**
1. Is exemption FULL or PARTIAL?
2. If board certified in Year 1, is Year 2-3 CME required?
3. Which boards qualify? (ABMS only? AOA? RCPSC?)
4. Must certification be active at renewal or just obtained during cycle?
5. What if certification lapses during exemption year?

---

### Step 7: Admin & Audit Complexity (1-2 hours)

Tier 3 states often have complex audit procedures.

**Research:**
1. What percentage of renewals audited annually?
2. Are audits random or for-cause?
3. How many days to respond to audit?
4. What documentation required? (certificates, transcripts, other?)
5. Penalty for non-response?
6. Penalty for shortfall?
7. Appeal process?

---

### Step 8: Reinstatement for Complex States (1 hour)

Tier 3 states may have complex reinstatement requirements, especially with multiple CME topics.

**Research:**
1. Lapsed < 1 year: CME makeup or current cycle only?
2. Lapsed 1-3 years: Which CME topics required?
3. Lapsed > 3 years: Full reapplication or special lapsed applicant process?
4. Do specialty-specific requirements apply to reinstatement?
