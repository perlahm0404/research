- **Audit Rate:** [To be verified]

---

## 1. Board Information & Regulatory Authority

### Official Board Information

[FACT - BOARD] The Missouri State Board of Registration for the Healing Arts is the official regulatory agency for physicians in Missouri. Website: https://www.pr.mo.gov/physiciansandsurgeons.asp. Phone: (573) 751-0098. (Accessed 2026-01-02)

[FACT - STATUTE] The Missouri State Board of Registration for the Healing Arts' authority derives from Missouri Revised Statutes Chapter 334 (Physicians and Surgeons).

### Primary Statutory Framework

[FACT - STATUTE] Missouri Revised Statutes Chapter 334 establishes the statutory foundation for medical licensure and continuing education in Missouri.

[FACT - ADMIN_CODE] Missouri Code of State Regulations 20 CSR 2150 provides detailed regulations for medical licensing and CME requirements.

[FACT - STATUTE] RSMo 334.037 specifically addresses continuing medical education requirements for physicians.

[FACT - BOARD] Missouri operates a unified board structure (Missouri State Board of Registration for the Healing Arts regulates both MD and DO physicians).

[CRITICAL GAP] Whether MD and DO physicians have identical CME requirements or different requirements under the unified board is not documented in available materials.

---

## 2. Renewal Cycle & Dates

### Biennial Renewal Schedule

[FACT - STATUTE] Missouri physicians renew their medical licenses every 2 years (biennial renewal cycle).

[CRITICAL GAP] Specific renewal deadline dates (e.g., birth month, December 31, license issue date) are not documented in available materials.

**Common Biennial Renewal Patterns:**
- Birth month-based (staggered throughout year)
- Fixed date (e.g., June 30 or December 31 for all physicians)
- License issue anniversary date

[RECOMMENDATION] Contact the Missouri State Board of Registration for the Healing Arts to clarify biennial renewal deadline structure.

### Renewal Timeline & Submission Windows

[CRITICAL GAP] The exact timeline for when physicians may begin renewal before expiration, notification procedures, and submission windows are not documented in available research materials.

### Grace Period & Late Renewal

[CRITICAL GAP] Grace period mechanics, late fees, and consequences of missed renewal deadlines are not documented in available materials.

---

## 3. CME Requirements - Base Hours & Categories

### Total CME Hours Required (Standard Pathway)

[FACT - STATUTE] Missouri requires 50 hours of continuing medical education every 2 years (biennial cycle).

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] This is a moderate-to-high biennial requirement compared to other states:
- **Higher than:** 40-hour states (Georgia, Idaho, Iowa, Mississippi)
- **Same as:** Maryland, Nevada MD, Texas, Virginia (all 50 hrs/2yr)
- **Lower than:** 60-hour states (Illinois 150/3yr = 50/yr, North Carolina 60/3yr)

Missouri's 50-hour requirement is STANDARD among higher-requirement biennial states.

### Category Requirements (Standard Pathway)

[FACT - STATUTE] All 50 hours of Missouri CME must be **AMA PRA Category 1** or **AOA Category 1A or Category 2A** credit.

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] This means:
- AMA PRA Category 1 Credit is acceptable
- AOA Category 1A Credit is acceptable (osteopathic formal CME)
- AOA Category 2A Credit is acceptable (osteopathic cognitive CME)
- NO AMA Category 2 credit accepted (informal self-study)
- Only formal, accredited CME from approved providers

[CRITICAL - UNIFIED BOARD IMPACT] Missouri's acceptance of both AMA and AOA categories reflects its unified board structure regulating both MD and DO physicians. This provides flexibility for physicians to select CME from either allopathic or osteopathic providers.

**Category Comparison:**
- **AMA Category 1:** Formal accredited CME (live courses, enduring materials with assessment)
- **AOA Category 1A:** Osteopathic formal CME (equivalent to AMA Category 1)
- **AOA Category 2A:** Osteopathic cognitive CME (self-directed learning with documentation)

[CRITICAL GAP] Whether there are any limits on the proportion of AOA Category 2A credit (e.g., maximum percentage) or if all 50 hours can be AOA 2A is not documented.

### Alternative Pathway: 40 Hours Category 1 with Post-Testing

[FACT - STATUTE] Missouri offers an alternative compliance pathway: **40 hours of AMA PRA Category 1 credit with post-testing**.

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] This alternative:
- Requires FEWER hours (40 vs. 50)
- Requires MORE rigorous verification (post-testing to demonstrate knowledge retention)
- Limits to AMA Category 1 only (excludes AOA 2A)
- Provides flexibility for physicians who prefer verified learning with reduced hour burden

**Comparison of Pathways:**

| Pathway | Hours | Categories Accepted | Verification |
|---------|-------|---------------------|--------------|
| Standard | 50 hrs | AMA Cat 1, AOA 1A, AOA 2A | None |
| Alternative | 40 hrs | AMA Cat 1 only | Post-testing required |

[CRITICAL GAP] Details about post-testing:
- What constitutes acceptable post-testing (CME provider assessments, board exams, other)?
- Must post-testing be for all 40 hours or a minimum percentage?
- Who administers/validates post-testing?
- Is post-testing separate from the CME course or integrated?

[RECOMMENDATION] Contact Missouri Board to clarify post-testing requirements and acceptable verification methods.

---

## 4. CME Topic Requirements - Mandatory Topics

### No Mandatory Topics Documented

[FACT - STATUTE] Research identified NO mandatory CME topics for Missouri physicians beyond the base 50-hour (or 40-hour with testing) requirement.

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] Missouri does NOT require:
- Opioid prescribing education
- Pain management CME
- Ethics or professionalism CME
- Controlled substance prescribing CME
- Specialty-specific topics

This is NOTABLE and contributes to Missouri's TIER 1 (simple) classification.

**Comparison to Other States:**
- **Missouri:** No mandatory topics
- **Mississippi:** 5 hours controlled substance (DEA holders)
- **Louisiana:** 3 hours drug diversion one-time (CDS holders), 1 hour nutrition every 2 years (FM/IM/peds/OB)
- **Iowa:** Child abuse (2 hrs/3yr), adult abuse (2 hrs/3yr), opioid (2 hrs/5yr), end-of-life (1 hr/5yr)
- **Illinois:** Sexual harassment, implicit bias, opioids, cultural competency, dementia (multiple 3-year and 6-year cycles)

Missouri's lack of mandatory topics is SIMPLER than most states and significantly reduces compliance complexity.

[CRITICAL GAP] Whether Missouri has any pending mandatory topic requirements (e.g., opioid education, implicit bias, nutrition) is not documented.

---

## 5. Specialty-Specific CME Requirements

### No Specialty-Specific Requirements Documented

[FACT - STATUTE] Research identified no specialty-specific CME requirements beyond the general 50-hour biennial requirement.

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] Missouri does not impose additional CME burdens on specific specialties (e.g., pain management clinics, OB/GYN, emergency medicine) beyond the base 50-hour requirement.

---

## 6. Exemptions & Special Circumstances

### Board Certification Exemption (ABMS)

[FACT - STATUTE] Physicians who complete **ABMS (American Board of Medical Specialties) board certification or recertification during the reporting period** are **exempt from CME requirements** for that renewal cycle.

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] This means:
- Board certification or recertification DURING the 2-year renewal period = full exemption
- Board certification obtained BEFORE or AFTER the renewal period does NOT provide exemption
- The exemption applies to the ENTIRE 50-hour requirement (not partial credit)

**Key Characteristics:**
- **Timing:** Certification/recertification must occur during the 2-year reporting period
- **Scope:** Full exemption (0 hours required)
- **Board Type:** ABMS only (AOA board certification not explicitly mentioned)

[CRITICAL GAP] Whether AOA board certification provides the same exemption as ABMS board certification is not documented. Since Missouri is a unified board accepting AOA CME categories, AOA board certification may also be accepted, but this requires verification.

[RECOMMENDATION] Contact Missouri Board to clarify:
1. Whether AOA board certification provides exemption (same as ABMS)
2. Exact timing requirements (when within 2-year period)
3. Documentation required to claim exemption

### MOC (Maintenance of Certification) Programs

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] ABMS Maintenance of Certification (MOC) programs likely qualify for the board certification exemption, as MOC is the ongoing process of maintaining board certification.

[CRITICAL GAP] Whether MOC activities (if not resulting in certification/recertification during the period) provide CME credit or partial exemption is not documented.

### New Licensee Exemption

[CRITICAL GAP] Whether newly licensed physicians are exempt from the 50-hour CME requirement for their first renewal is not documented.

### Other Exemptions

[CRITICAL GAP] Whether exemptions exist for:
- Retired physicians
- Inactive licenses
- Military service
- Hardship circumstances
- Resident physicians

These are not documented in available materials.

---

## 7. Regulatory Timeline & Effective Dates

### Current Requirements Status

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] The 50-hour biennial requirement (or 40-hour with testing alternative) and ABMS board certification exemption are currently in effect based on FSMB data.

[CRITICAL GAP] The specific effective dates for these requirements, and any historical changes or amendments, are not documented in available materials.

**Timeline of Missouri MD CME Regulatory Changes:**

| Date | Requirement | Status | Reference |
|------|-------------|--------|-----------|
| [Date TBD] | 50 hours/2yr (AMA Cat 1 or AOA 1A/2A) | EFFECTIVE (baseline) | RSMo 334.037 |
| [Date TBD] | Alternative: 40 hours Cat 1 with post-testing | EFFECTIVE | 20 CSR 2150 |
| [Date TBD] | ABMS board cert exemption during period | EFFECTIVE | 20 CSR 2150 |

[RECOMMENDATION] Research Missouri Revised Statutes 334.037 and Missouri Code of State Regulations 20 CSR 2150 directly to obtain effective dates and historical context.

---

## 8. Controlled Substance & Opioid Requirements

### No State Controlled Substance CME Requirement Found

[CRITICAL - NOTABLE ABSENCE] Unlike many states (e.g., Mississippi 5 hours, Louisiana 3 hours one-time, Iowa 2 hours/5yr), Missouri has NO state-mandated controlled substance or opioid prescribing CME requirement.

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] Missouri physicians are NOT required to complete opioid, pain management, or controlled substance prescribing CME for state licensure renewal (though they may choose to for professional development or other credentialing requirements).

### Federal DEA MATE Act Requirement (Separate from Missouri State CME)

[FACT - STATUTE] The federal Medication Access and Training Expansion (MATE) Act (effective June 27, 2023) requires physicians applying for or renewing DEA registration to attest they have completed 8 hours of training on opioid or other substance use disorders.

[FACT - STATUTE] The MATE Act requirement is:
- One-time for newly registering physicians (after June 27, 2023)
- Required at DEA registration renewal for continuing registrants
- Separate from Missouri state CME requirements
- Available as free attestation for recent medical school graduates (graduated within 5 years of June 27, 2023)

[CRITICAL - FEDERAL REQUIREMENT ONLY] DEA-registered physicians in Missouri must comply with the federal 8-hour MATE Act requirement, but this is SEPARATE from state licensure renewal. There is NO state-level opioid CME requirement.

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] The federal MATE Act 8-hour training does NOT count toward Missouri's 50-hour state CME requirement unless the training is AMA Category 1 or AOA 1A/2A accredited (which many MATE Act courses are).

---

## 9. CME Tracking & Compliance Verification

### Documentation Requirements

[CRITICAL GAP] Specific documentation requirements (certificates, transcripts, self-attestation, etc.) are not documented in available materials.

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] Based on typical state practice, physicians likely must:
- Maintain certificates of completion for all CME
- Provide documentation upon request or during audit
- Retain records for a specified period (e.g., 5-7 years)
- Verify Category 1/1A/2A accreditation for all courses

### Post-Testing Documentation (Alternative Pathway)

[CRITICAL GAP] Physicians choosing the 40-hour with post-testing alternative must provide documentation of post-testing completion. The specific format, providers, and verification procedures are not documented.

### Audit Procedures

[CRITICAL GAP] Whether the Missouri State Board of Registration for the Healing Arts conducts audits of CME compliance, and if so, the frequency and procedures, is not documented in available materials.

[RECOMMENDATION] Contact Missouri Board to clarify audit procedures and documentation retention requirements.

---

## 10. Renewal Procedures & Fees

### Standard Renewal Process

[FACT - BOARD] Missouri physicians renew through the Missouri Division of Professional Registration online portal (exact URL to be verified).

[CRITICAL GAP] The exact renewal portal URL, submission procedures, and renewal window details are not documented in available materials beyond the general board website.

### Renewal Fees

[CRITICAL GAP] The specific biennial renewal fee amount for Missouri medical licenses is not documented in available research materials.

### Grace Period & Late Renewal

[CRITICAL GAP] Grace period mechanics, late fees, and consequences of expired licenses are not documented in available materials.

---

## 11. Unified Board Structure & MD/DO Considerations

### Missouri's Unified Board Model

[FACT - BOARD] Missouri operates a unified board (Missouri State Board of Registration for the Healing Arts) that regulates both MD and DO physicians.

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] The acceptance of both AMA and AOA CME categories (Category 1, 1A, 2A) reflects this unified structure and provides flexibility for all physicians regardless of degree type.

### CME Category Flexibility

[FACT - STATUTE] Missouri accepts:
- **AMA PRA Category 1** (allopathic formal CME)
- **AOA Category 1A** (osteopathic formal CME)
- **AOA Category 2A** (osteopathic cognitive CME)

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] This flexibility allows:
- MDs to take AOA-accredited CME if desired
- DOs to take AMA-accredited CME
- Both to mix and match accreditation types to reach 50 hours

[CRITICAL - COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE] Missouri's category flexibility may attract physicians from other states with stricter requirements (e.g., states requiring 100% AMA Category 1 only).

### Comparison to Split-Board States

**Split-Board States:**
- Arizona: Separate MD and DO boards, different requirements
- Tennessee: Separate MD and DO boards, different renewal dates and fees
- Vermont: Separate MD and DO boards, different regulatory agencies

**Unified Board (Missouri):**
- Single board for both MD and DO
- Flexible CME categories accepted
- Likely same renewal dates and fees (to be verified)

[CRITICAL GAP] Whether MD and DO physicians in Missouri have identical CME requirements (50 hours, same categories, same exemptions) or any differences is not documented.

---

## 12. Comparison to Other TIER 1 States

### Missouri vs. Other Simple Biennial States

**Missouri:** 50 hours/2yr (AMA Cat 1 or AOA 1A/2A) OR 40 hours Cat 1 with post-testing; ABMS cert exemption; no mandatory topics

**Similar TIER 1 States:**
- **Mississippi:** 40 hours/2yr, all Category 1, 5 hrs controlled substance (DEA holders)
- **Louisiana:** 20 hours/year (= 40 hrs/2yr), all Category 1, 3 hrs drug diversion one-time, 1 hr nutrition/2yr (specialty)
- **Iowa:** 40 hours/2yr, up to 20 hrs carryover, multiple 3-year and 5-year topics
- **Indiana:** NO set hours, 2 hrs opioid only

**Key Differences:**
- Missouri requires MORE hours (50 vs. 40 in most TIER 1 states)
- Missouri has NO mandatory topics (simpler than Mississippi, Louisiana, Iowa)
- Missouri offers post-testing alternative (unique flexibility)
- Missouri has ABMS board cert exemption (simpler compliance for board-certified physicians)

**Missouri's Position:** Missouri is TIER 1 (simple) due to absence of mandatory topics and clear exemption pathways, despite having a higher base hour requirement (50 vs. 40). The post-testing alternative and board certification exemption provide significant flexibility.

## Conclusion

Missouri MD license renewal requirements are **simple and flexible** (TIER 1) with a clear biennial structure, no mandatory topics, and multiple compliance pathways.

**Core Requirements Summary:**
- 50 hours CME every 2 years (AMA Category 1 or AOA Category 1A/2A)
- Alternative: 40 hours AMA Category 1 with post-testing
- Board certification exemption: ABMS certification/recertification during reporting period provides full exemption
- No mandatory specialty topics
- Unified board structure (regulates both MD and DO)

**Key Simplicity Factors:**
1. No mandatory topics beyond base hour requirement (simpler than most states)
2. ABMS board certification provides full exemption (clear alternative compliance)
3. Post-testing alternative offers reduced hours (40 vs. 50) with verification
4. Flexible CME categories accepted (AMA Cat 1, AOA 1A, AOA 2A)
5. Unified board structure provides category flexibility for all physicians

**Key Flexibility Factors:**
1. Multiple compliance pathways (standard 50 hrs, alternative 40 hrs with testing, board cert exemption)
2. Category flexibility (AMA or AOA accreditation accepted)
3. Board certification exemption reduces burden for board-certified physicians

**For Physician Compliance:** Choose one pathway: (1) Complete 50 hours AMA Category 1 or AOA 1A/2A CME every 2 years, OR (2) Complete 40 hours AMA Category 1 with post-testing, OR (3) Obtain ABMS board certification/recertification during the 2-year reporting period for full exemption. Verify biennial renewal deadline with board. No mandatory topics required.

**For Rules Engine Implementation:** Track 50-hour biennial requirement with category validation (AMA Cat 1, AOA 1A, AOA 2A). Implement alternative pathway logic (40 hours Cat 1 + post-testing verification). Implement board certification exemption (ABMS cert/recert during period = 0 hours required). No mandatory topic tracking needed. Verify whether AOA board certification provides same exemption as ABMS.

**Critical Next Steps:**
1. Contact Missouri State Board of Registration for the Healing Arts at (573) 751-0098 to clarify:
   - Biennial renewal deadline structure and dates
   - Post-testing alternative details (providers, format, validation)
   - AOA board certification exemption (same as ABMS?)
   - MD vs. DO requirement differences (if any)
   - New licensee exemption
   - Renewal fees, grace period, and procedures
   - Audit and documentation requirements
2. Review Missouri Revised Statutes 334.037 and 20 CSR 2150 for full statutory and regulatory details
3. Monitor Missouri Board website for any regulatory changes or pending mandatory topics
