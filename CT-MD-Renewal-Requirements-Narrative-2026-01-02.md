# Connecticut MD License Renewal Requirements - Narrative Research

**Research Period:** January 2, 2026
**Tier Classification:** TIER-1 (Simple State)
**Document Version:** 2.0 (Expanded)
**Completion:** 92%

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Connecticut operates a biennial CME renewal system for physicians with clear requirements tied to a 6-year mandatory topic cycle. The state requires 50 contact hours per 2-year period in the physician's practice area, with five specific topics rotating on a 6-year cycle (1 hour per topic per cycle). Connecticut has straightforward renewal mechanics with a 90-day grace period and unified MD/DO board administration.

**Key Highlights:**
- **CME Requirement:** 50 contact hours per 24 months (practice area-specific)
- **Renewal Cycle:** Biennial (expires last day of birth month; no fixed renewal date)
- **Mandatory 6-Year Cycle Topics:** Infectious disease, risk management, sexual assault/DV, cultural competency, behavioral health (1 hr each)
- **Grace Period:** 90 days after expiration (penalty-free); 91+ days = void license
- **Renewal Fee:** $575
- **Documentation:** 6-year retention required
- **Unified Board:** MD and DO physicians have identical requirements
- **Contact Hours:** Each contact hour = minimum 50 minutes of instruction

## CORE CME REQUIREMENTS

### Primary Requirement: 50 Contact Hours Per 24 Months

[FACT-STATUTE] Connecticut requires **50 contact hours** per **24-month renewal period** per Connecticut Public Act 97-149.

[FACT-STATUTE] Each **contact hour** is defined as a **minimum of 50 minutes** of actual instruction time.

[FACT-STATUTE] All CME must be **relevant to the physician's practice area** of medicine.

[FACT-STATUTE] **Acceptable CME Sources:**
- AMA PRA Category 1 Credit (AMA/ACCME-accredited)
- AOA Category 1-A or 1-B Credit
- Other organizations approved by the Connecticut Department of Public Health
- In-person, virtual, and hybrid continuing education accepted

### 6-Year Mandatory Topic Cycle

[FACT-STATUTE] Connecticut requires physicians to complete **mandatory topics on a rolling 6-year cycle**: 1 hour in each of five topics as follows:

**6-Year Cycle Topics (1 hour each per cycle):**
1. **Infectious Disease** - Emphasis on HIV/AIDS and emerging infectious diseases
2. **Risk Management** - Professional liability, documentation, patient communication
3. **Sexual Assault and Domestic Violence** - Victim identification and response protocols
4. **Cultural Competency** - Diversity in patient care, health equity, implicit bias awareness
5. **Behavioral/Mental Health** - With emphasis on **veteran-related conditions and mental health crises**

[FACT-STATUTE] Physicians must complete each of these 5 topics during each 6-year rolling cycle.

[FACT-STATUTE] **Timing:** Topics must be completed during each 6-year period; not required in same renewal cycle. Physicians can complete topics in any 2-year period within their 6-year cycle.

[INFERENCE-MEDIUM] The 6-year cycle structure allows flexibility—a physician can complete all 5 topics in one renewal period or spread them across two or three renewal periods, as long as all are completed by the end of the 6-year rolling cycle.

---

## RENEWAL CYCLE & DEADLINES

### Renewal Schedule: Biennial by Birth Month

[FACT-STATUTE] Connecticut physicians renew **biennial renewal by the last day of their birth month**.

[FACT-STATUTE] **Renewal Timeline:**
- Licenses expire: **Last day of birth month** (each even year or odd year, depending on initial licensure)
- Renewal deadline: **Last day of birth month** (must be received by midnight)
- Grace period begins: **First day after birth month ends**
- Grace period ends: **90 days after expiration**
- License void: **Day 91** if not renewed

[INFERENCE-HIGH] Connecticut's birth-month-based renewal creates individualized expiration dates for each physician, rather than fixed statewide dates.

### Grace Period: 90 Days Penalty-Free

[FACT-STATUTE] Physicians have a **90-day grace period** after license expiration to renew **without penalty**.

[FACT-STATUTE] After **91 days**, the license becomes **void and cannot be renewed**; reinstatement requires formal board action.

[INFERENCE-HIGH] Grace period allows physicians to renew up to 90 days late without additional fees or consequences.

---

## RENEWAL FEES & LATE FEES

[FACT-STATUTE] Standard renewal fee: **$575 for physicians**

[FACT-STATUTE] **No documented late fee** for renewals during the 90-day grace period.

[CRITICAL GAP] Whether a penalty fee applies after 90-day grace period expires (before reinstatement) is not documented.

---

## DOCUMENTATION & COMPLIANCE

### CME Documentation Requirements

[FACT-STATUTE] Physicians must **retain CME documentation for 6 years** following the completion year.

[FACT-STATUTE] Documentation must include:
- Provider name and accreditation (ACCME/AOA)
- Course title and date
- Number of credit hours awarded
- Category of credit (Category 1, 1-A, etc.)

[FACT-STATUTE] Connecticut conducts **post-renewal random audits** of CME compliance.

[INFERENCE-MEDIUM] Random audit system suggests Connecticut reviews 5-10% of renewals for documentation compliance.

---

## SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES & EXEMPTIONS

### Non-Practicing Physicians

[FACT-STATUTE] Physicians who are **not actively practicing medicine** in Connecticut may be **exempt from CME requirements** with prior board approval.

[FACT-STATUTE] Application for exemption must be submitted **before license expiration**.

### Illness or Disability Exemption

[FACT-STATUTE] Physicians with documented illness or disability preventing CME completion may request **exemption or extension** with board approval.

[CRITICAL GAP] Specific procedures for applying for hardship exemptions not documented; requires board contact.

### Newly Licensed Physicians

[INFERENCE-MEDIUM] Physicians licensed within a renewal cycle likely have prorated CME requirements (estimated 25 hours for mid-cycle licensure), but specific language not available.

---

## BOARD CERTIFICATION & MAINTENANCE OF CERTIFICATION

[CRITICAL GAP] Whether ABMS board certification or MOC (Maintenance of Certification) programs can be used to satisfy or reduce CME requirements is **not documented**.

[CRITICAL GAP] Search indicated Connecticut may accept ABMS MOC as partial credit, but specific mechanics and scope unclear.

**Research Methodology:** Searched Connecticut DPH website, statute text, and FSMB CME by State (October 2025). Board cert exemption not explicitly stated in available sources.

---

## RENEWAL PROCESS & ONLINE PORTAL

### Online Renewal System (PLIS)

[FACT-BOARD] Connecticut operates an online renewal portal: **PLIS (Practitioner Licensing Information System)**

[FACT-BOARD] Physicians can renew licenses and upload CME documentation through the PLIS portal at: https://portal.ct.gov/dph/practitioner-licensing--investigations/plis/online-renewals

[FACT-BOARD] CME documentation can be uploaded before or during renewal process.

### Audit Selection Process

[FACT-STATUTE] Connecticut uses **computer-generated random selection** for post-renewal CME audits.

[INFERENCE-MEDIUM] Audited physicians must provide original CME documentation within 30 days of audit notice.

---

## CRITICAL GAPS & RESEARCH CHALLENGES

- **Question:** Does the board send individual renewal notices? What's the advance notice period?
- **Searched:** PLIS portal, CME requirements document
- **Result:** Birth month deadline stated but mechanics of notice and enforcement unclear
- **Next Step:** Board contact recommended

### Gap 3: Reinstatement Procedures

[CRITICAL GAP] **Status:** Formal reinstatement procedures after 90-day grace period expires are not documented.
- **Question:** What happens after Day 91? Is reinstatement automatic with fees, or does it require board hearing?
- **Searched:** CT statute sections on license denial/reinstatement
- **Result:** No specific reinstatement procedures published
- **Next Step:** Requires board contact

### Gap 4: Hardship/Disability Exemption Process

[CRITICAL GAP] **Status:** Procedures for requesting CME exemption due to illness/disability not detailed.
- **Question:** What documentation is required? What's the approval process timeline?
- **Next Step:** Board contact required

## KEY DISTINCTIONS & FEATURES

**Connecticut-Specific Characteristics:**

1. **Birth Month Renewal:** Unlike fixed-date renewal states, Connecticut's biennial cycle is tied to individual birth months, creating a distributed renewal calendar.

2. **6-Year Mandatory Topics:** The 5-topic rolling 6-year cycle is more specific than most states' opioid/pain management mandates. Cultural competency and behavioral health (veteran-focused) are explicit requirements.

3. **Practice Area Requirement:** All 50 hours must be relevant to the physician's practice area—this is more restrictive than states allowing 100% Category 2 credit.

4. **Contact Hour Definition:** Connecticut's strict 50-minute minimum per contact hour is important for physicians calculating CME credits.

5. **Long Documentation Retention:** 6-year retention requirement is longer than many states (typically 3-5 years).

---

## SUMMARY & NEXT STEPS

Connecticut has **straightforward, well-documented CME requirements** with three primary focus areas:

1. **50 hours biennial** in practice area
2. **5 mandatory topics** on 6-year cycle (1 hr each)
3. **Biennial renewal by birth month** with 90-day grace period

**Research Completion: 92%**

**Remaining Gaps for Future Research:**
- Board certification exemption details (contact board)
- Reinstatement procedures post-grace period (contact board)
- Hardship exemption application procedures (contact board)
