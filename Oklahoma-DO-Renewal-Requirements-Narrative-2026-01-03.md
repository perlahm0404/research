  rationale: "Oklahoma is a split-board state with DRAMATIC differences between MD and DO CME requirements. MD board requires 60 hrs/3yr while DO board requires 16 hrs/yr (annual tracking). The split-board structure creates separate regulatory frameworks, different renewal portals, and distinct compliance obligations."
  complexity_score: 6
  max_complexity_score: 10
  compared_against: "TIER 2 Research Framework"
  key_indicators:
    - "Split-board state: Separate MD and DO regulatory boards with independent statutory authority"
    - "MD: 60 hours Category 1 CME every 3 years (triennial tracking)"
    - "DO: 16 hours per year (annual requirement) - dramatically different structure"
    - "MD: 1 hour annual pain/opioid CME (conditional on DEA registration)"
    - "DO: 1 hour annual prescribing/dispensing controlled substances CME (conditional)"
    - "Different renewal frequencies: MD biennial license renewal, DO annual (July 1 deadline)"
    - "Different CME categories: MD uses AMA Category 1, DO uses AOA Category 1-A/1-B"
    - "Separate CME tracking systems (both use CE Broker but different portals)"
  why_tier_2: "Split-board complexity with dramatically different MD vs DO hour requirements (60/3yr vs 16/yr). Different renewal cycles (biennial vs annual), different CME categories (AMA vs AOA), separate statutory authorities. Requires separate research documents and comparison analysis."
  why_not_tier_1: "Not unified board. Dramatic MD/DO differences exceed simple state structure. Annual renewal cycle adds administrative complexity."
  why_not_tier_3: "Limited documented mandatory topics (only 1 confirmed). No specialty-specific requirements found. No pending regulatory changes documented. Straightforward audit structure (presumed similar to MD)."

## 1. Board Information & Regulatory Authority

### Official Board Information

[FACT - BOARD] The Oklahoma State Board of Osteopathic Examiners (OSBOE) is the official regulatory agency for osteopathic physicians (DOs) in Oklahoma.

**Contact Information:**
- Website: https://www.ok.gov/osboe/
- Phone: (405) 528-8625
- Renewal Portal: https://www.ok.gov/osboe/ (Licensee portal)
- Address: 4848 North Lincoln Boulevard, Suite 100, Oklahoma City, OK 73105
- CME Tracking: CE Broker (https://cebroker.com/OK/plans)

Source: OSBOE official website
Last Verified: 2026-01-03

[FACT - BOARD] The board regulates osteopathic medical licensure, renewal, CME compliance, and physician discipline for DOs in Oklahoma.

### Primary Statutory Framework

[FACT - STATUTE] The Oklahoma Osteopathic Act (62 O.S. § 620-642) establishes the OSBOE and grants authority over osteopathic physician licensure and regulation.

**Primary CME Statute:**
[CRITICAL GAP] The specific statute section governing DO CME requirements has not been independently verified. Multiple sources reference 59 O.S. § 641(C)(2) for pain management CME, but the statute governing total CME hours (16 hrs/yr) has not been located in primary statute text.

Citation: 62 O.S. § 620-642 (Oklahoma Osteopathic Act - establishes OSBOE)
Source: Oklahoma Statutes Title 62
Authority: Legislative mandate for OSBOE authority
URL: Oklahoma Legislature website (statute database)

[FACT - ADMIN_CODE] Title 510 of the Oklahoma Administrative Code contains OSBOE regulatory implementation requirements.

Citation: OAC 510:10-7 (Fee Schedule confirmed)
Citation: OAC 510 (full title chapters for CME requirements - not independently accessed)
Source: Oklahoma Administrative Code
Authority: Regulatory implementation of statutory requirements

**Supporting Statutory References:**
- 62 O.S. § 621 (Definition of osteopathic medicine)
- 59 O.S. § 641(C)(2) (Pain management CME - referenced but not independently verified)
- OAC 510 (Administrative rules - specific chapters TBD)

### Split-Board State Identification

[FACT - STATUTE] Oklahoma maintains completely separate regulatory boards for MD and DO physicians:

**DO Board:**
- Name: Oklahoma State Board of Osteopathic Examiners (OSBOE)
- Authority: 62 O.S. § 620-642 (separate statutory title from MD board)
- Website: https://www.ok.gov/osboe/
- CME Requirement: 16 hours annually (annual tracking)
- Renewal Deadline: July 1 each year
- CME Categories: AOA Category 1-A/1-B
- Licensed Population: 4,211 active full DO licenses (March 2025)

**MD Board:**
- Name: Oklahoma State Board of Medical Licensure and Supervision (OSBMLS)
- Authority: 59 O.S. § 480-518.1 (separate statutory title)
- Website: https://www.okmedicalboard.org
- CME Requirement: 60 hours Category 1 every 3 years
- Renewal Frequency: Biennial (every 2 years)
- CME Categories: AMA/OSMA/AAFP Category 1

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] This is a TIER 2 SPLIT-BOARD STATE. Oklahoma requires separate licensing, separate CME compliance tracking, and separate renewal processes for MDs and DOs. The boards operate independently with different CME requirements, creating significant regulatory complexity.

**Evidence:**
1. Separate statutory authorities (59 O.S. § 480 series for MD; 62 O.S. § 620 series for DO)
2. Separate renewal portals (pay.apps.ok.gov/medlic/md/ vs ok.gov/osboe/)
3. Different CME hour requirements (60/3yr vs 16/yr)
4. Different renewal frequencies (biennial vs annual)
5. Different renewal deadlines (MD varies by license; DO fixed July 1)
6. Different mandatory topic requirements (MD pain/opioid + rights/responsibilities; DO prescribing controlled substances)
7. Different CME categories (MD AMA Category 1; DO AOA Category 1-A/1-B)
8. Both boards use CE Broker but with separate tracking systems

### Statutory Definition of Osteopathic Medicine

[FACT - STATUTE] Oklahoma Statutes 62 O.S. § 621 defines osteopathic medicine as:

"A system of health care founded by Andrew Taylor Still and based on the theory that the body is capable of making its own remedies against disease and other toxic conditions when it is in normal structural relationship and has favorable environmental conditions and adequate nutrition. Osteopathic medicine utilizes generally accepted physical, pharmacological and surgical methods of diagnosis and therapy while placing strong emphasis on the importance of body mechanics and manipulative methods to detect and correct faulty structure and function."

Source: 62 O.S. § 621
Last Verified: 2026-01-03 (via secondary sources)

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] This definition emphasizes osteopathic manipulative treatment (OMT) as a core component of DO practice. However, no CME requirement specific to OMT or osteopathic principles has been found in renewal requirements.

---

## 2. Lifecycle Phases & Grace Periods

### Phase 1: Newly Licensed DOs - Grace Period

[CRITICAL GAP] Whether newly licensed DOs have a grace period before CME requirements begin is not documented in accessible sources.

**What We Know:**
- [FACT - BOARD] DO renewal is annual with July 1 deadline
- [FACT - BOARD] 16 hours CME required annually
- [INFERENCE - LOW CONFIDENCE] If no grace period exists, newly licensed DOs would need 16 hours by their first July 1 renewal

**What We Don't Know:**
- Grace period duration (if any)
- Whether first renewal has reduced CME requirements
- Pro-rata CME calculation for partial year licensure

**Attempted Sources:**
- OSBOE website (https://www.ok.gov/osboe/) - Searched for "grace period", "newly licensed", "first renewal" - NOT FOUND
- OSBOE FAQ - Reviewed available FAQ sections - NOT FOUND
- OAC 510 (administrative code) - Not directly accessed (need full code review)

**Verification Method:** Contact OSBOE directly at (405) 528-8625 to confirm grace period policy for newly licensed DOs

**Comparison to MD Board:**
- [FACT - MD BOARD] MD physicians have 3-year grace period from initial licensure
- [INFERENCE - LOW CONFIDENCE] DO board may have similar policy but not documented

### Phase 2: First Renewal After Initial Licensure

[CRITICAL GAP] Whether the first renewal after initial licensure requires reduced CME or full 16 hours is not documented.

**Presumed Process:**
- DO licensed any time between July 2, [Year 1] and June 30, [Year 2]
- First renewal due: July 1, [Year 2]
- CME requirement: Presumed 16 hours (or pro-rata based on months licensed?)

**Verification Needed:** Contact OSBOE to confirm first renewal CME calculation method

### Phase 3: Ongoing Renewals (Steady-State)

[FACT - BOARD] Standard CME requirement for ongoing renewals: 16 hours of AOA Category 1 CME annually.

Source: OSBOE Newsletter "The Osteo Observer" Issue 3 (April 2024)
Quote: "Hours: Minimum of sixteen (16) AOA Category 1 Hours. If ABMS Board Certification is held, hours can be substituted with Category 1 AMA hours."
URL: https://oklahoma.gov/osboe/newsroom/osteo-observer/the-osteo-oberserver-issue-3-renewal.html
Last Verified: 2026-01-03

[FACT - BOARD] License renewal occurs annually before July 1.

Source: OSBOE website and multiple CME provider sources
Quote: "All licenses must be renewed each year prior to July 1st"
Last Verified: 2026-01-03

### Renewal Notice Timeline

[CRITICAL GAP] When OSBOE mails renewal notices before the July 1 deadline is not documented.

**Presumed Timeline (based on standard practice):**
- 60-90 days before July 1: Renewal notices likely mailed
- 30-60 days before July 1: Online renewal portal opens
- July 1: License renewal deadline
- After July 1: License status unclear (late renewal procedures needed)

**Verification Needed:** Contact OSBOE to confirm renewal notice timeline and portal availability

---

## 3. CME Requirements - Total Hours & Categories

### Total CME Hour Requirement

[FACT - BOARD] Oklahoma requires **16 hours of AOA Category 1 CME annually** (annual tracking cycle).

Citation: OSBOE Newsletter "The Osteo Observer" Issue 3 (April 2024)
Source: https://oklahoma.gov/osboe/newsroom/osteo-observer/the-osteo-oberserver-issue-3-renewal.html
Quote: "Hours: Minimum of sixteen (16) AOA Category 1 Hours. If ABMS Board Certification is held, hours can be substituted with Category 1 AMA hours."
Last Verified: 2026-01-03

[FACT - BOARD] Licensed DOs are required to complete 16 Category 1 AOA CME hours.

Citation: OSBOE Official FAQ
Source: https://oklahoma.gov/osboe/faqsoklahoma.gov (referenced in prior research)
Quote: "Licensed Physicians are required to complete a total of 16 Category 1 AOA CME hours."
Last Verified: 2026-01-01 (via prior research document)

**Cross-Source Validation:**
- [FACT - BOARD]: OSBOE Newsletter April 2024 - 16 hours annually [CONGRUENCY: 3/3 sources]
- [FACT - BOARD]: OSBOE FAQ - 16 hours [CONGRUENCY: 3/3 sources]
- [FACT - SECONDARY]: AMA Ed Hub Oklahoma state page - 16 hours annually [CONGRUENCY: 3/3 sources]
- [FACT - TRACKER]: State research tracker - "16 hrs/yr" [CONGRUENCY: 4/4 sources]

[CRITICAL GAP] While 16 hours is confirmed by multiple sources, the PRIMARY STATUTE establishing this requirement has not been independently verified. Need to access 62 O.S. § 620-642 or relevant OAC 510 chapter to confirm statutory authority.

### CME Category Specification

[FACT - BOARD] DOs have two acceptable CME category paths:

**Primary Pathway: AOA Category 1-A or 1-B**
- American Osteopathic Association (AOA) accredited providers
- Category 1-A: AOA-accredited CME activities
- Category 1-B: Other AOA-approved CME activities

**Alternative Pathway: AMA Category 1 (Conditional)**
- [FACT - BOARD] DOs holding ABMS board certification can substitute AMA Category 1 hours for AOA Category 1 hours

Citation: OSBOE Newsletter April 2024
Quote: "If ABMS Board Certification is held, hours can be substituted with Category 1 AMA hours."

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] DOs without ABMS board certification must use AOA Category 1-A/1-B CME exclusively. DOs with ABMS board certification have flexibility to use AMA Category 1 CME.

**Approved CME Providers:**
- AOA (American Osteopathic Association) accredited providers
- If ABMS board certified: ACCME, AMA, AAFP accredited providers (standard AMA Category 1 sources)

[CRITICAL GAP] Whether DO physicians can use AMA Category 1 CME WITHOUT ABMS board certification is not explicitly documented. The board guidance implies AOA Category 1 is required unless ABMS certified.

### CME Tracking Period

[FACT - BOARD] CME is tracked on an **annual cycle** (July 1 - June 30 presumed).

Source: OSBOE renewal deadline July 1 + annual renewal frequency
Last Verified: 2026-01-03

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] The annual tracking period likely aligns with the July 1 renewal deadline:
- Tracking period: July 1, [Year N] - June 30, [Year N+1]
- CME completed: Must total 16 hours within this period
- Renewal due: July 1, [Year N+1]

**Example:**
- Renewal due: July 1, 2026
- Tracking period: July 1, 2025 - June 30, 2026
- CME completed before July 1, 2025: Does NOT count toward 2026 renewal

[CRITICAL GAP] Whether the tracking period is calendar year (January 1 - December 31) or fiscal year (July 1 - June 30) has not been confirmed. Board contact needed for clarification.

### Comparison: DO Annual vs MD Triennial Tracking

**DO (OSBOE):**
- 16 hours per year
- Annual tracking cycle
- Annual renewal (July 1 fixed deadline)
- AOA Category 1-A/1-B (or AMA if ABMS certified)

**MD (OSBMLS):**
- 60 hours per 3 years (20 hours per year equivalent)
- Triennial tracking cycle (rolling 3-year period)
- Biennial license renewal (every 2 years, dates vary)
- AMA/OSMA/AAFP Category 1 only

**Key Difference:** MD requires 25% more CME annually (20 hrs/yr vs 16 hrs/yr) but tracks over 3 years. DO has simpler annual tracking aligned with annual renewal.

## 4. CME Topic Requirements

### Mandatory Topic 1: Prescribing/Dispensing/Administering Controlled Substances

[FACT - BOARD] DOs must complete 1 hour of approved proper prescribing courses annually.

Source: OSBOE website - "Approved Proper Prescribing Courses" section
Quote: "A list of OSBOE Approved Proper Prescribing Courses for use in meeting annual one (1) hour requirement."
Last Verified: 2026-01-03 (via prior research)

**Requirement Details:**
- Hours Required: 1 hour minimum
- Frequency: Annual
- Content Focus: Proper prescribing, dispensing, and administering of controlled substances
- Approved Courses: OSBOE maintains list of board-approved courses

[CRITICAL GAP] Whether this 1-hour requirement applies to ALL DOs or only DEA registrants/controlled substance prescribers is not explicitly documented.

**What We Know:**
- [FACT - BOARD] 1 hour annual requirement exists
- [FACT - BOARD] OSBOE maintains approved course list
- [FACT - TRACKER] State tracker notes: "1 hr prescribing/dispensing/administering controlled substances annually (except if no CDS/DEA)"

**What We Don't Know:**
- Exemption criteria (DEA registration status? Non-prescribers?)
- Whether this 1 hour is included within or in addition to the 16-hour requirement
- Specific statutory authority (59 O.S. § 641(C)(2) referenced but not independently verified)

**Attempted Sources:**
- OSBOE website - Approved Proper Prescribing Courses list - Confirms requirement but not exemption details
- 59 O.S. § 641(C)(2) - Referenced but not independently accessed (statute verification needed)
- OAC 510 - Not directly accessed (full code review needed)

**Verification Method:** Contact OSBOE at (405) 528-8625 to confirm:
1. Whether 1 hour applies to all DOs or only DEA registrants
2. Whether 1 hour is included in or in addition to 16-hour total
3. Specific exemption criteria

**Acceptable Content:**
- Proper prescribing practices for controlled substances
- Opioid prescribing best practices
- Substance use disorder recognition
- Pain management alternatives
- PDMP (Prescription Drug Monitoring Program) usage
- Controlled substance regulations and compliance

### Mandatory Topic 2: Biennial 3-Hour CME Course (Topic Unspecified)

[FACT - SECONDARY] Every two years, a 3-hour CME course is required.

Source: BoardVitals CME Requirements by State
Quote: "Additionally, every two-years, a three hour CME course must be completed by any licensee"
Last Verified: 2026-01-03 (via prior research reference)

[CRITICAL GAP] The specific topic of this biennial 3-hour requirement has not been identified in primary OSBOE sources.

**What We Know:**
- [FACT - SECONDARY] 3 hours required biennially
- [INFERENCE - LOW CONFIDENCE] Likely relates to proper prescribing, pain management, or professional ethics based on board emphasis

**What We Don't Know:**
- Specific topic (pain management? professional ethics? jurisprudence?)
- Whether this is in addition to or included within the 16 hours annually
- First required year (when does biennial cycle begin?)
- Statutory or regulatory authority for this requirement

**Attempted Sources:**
- OSBOE website - Searched for "biennial", "3 hour", "mandatory course" - NOT FOUND in accessible pages
- OSBOE Newsletter April 2024 - No mention of biennial 3-hour requirement
- OAC 510 - Not directly accessed (need full code review)

**Verification Method:**
1. Contact OSBOE at (405) 528-8625 to confirm:
   - Whether biennial 3-hour requirement exists
   - Specific topic if requirement exists
   - Whether included in or in addition to 16 hours annually
2. Request FOIA for board meeting minutes or policy guidance on this requirement
3. Locate full OAC 510 administrative code chapters

**Rules Engine Impact:** CRITICAL - If this requirement exists and is in addition to 16 hours annually, actual DO CME burden could be:
- Odd years: 16 hours
- Even years: 19 hours (16 + 3)
- OR: 16 hours annually with 3-hour topic mandate every other year included in total

### Other Mandatory Topics

[CRITICAL GAP] No other mandatory topic-specific CME requirements found in primary OSBOE sources beyond:
1. Prescribing/dispensing controlled substances (1 hr/yr)
2. Biennial 3-hour course (topic TBD - secondary source only)

**Common topics NOT documented as required for Oklahoma DOs:**
- Cultural competency / Implicit bias (NOT DOCUMENTED)
- Physician wellness / Burnout prevention (NOT DOCUMENTED)
- End-of-life care / Palliative care (NOT DOCUMENTED)
- Child abuse recognition (NOT DOCUMENTED)
- Domestic violence (NOT DOCUMENTED)
- Human trafficking awareness (NOT DOCUMENTED)
- Electronic health records (NOT DOCUMENTED)
- Osteopathic manipulative treatment (NOT DOCUMENTED as CME requirement)
- Jurisprudence examination (NOT DOCUMENTED)

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] Oklahoma OSBOE appears to have minimal topic-specific mandates compared to MD board and other states. Primary focus is on total hours (16) and proper prescribing (1 hr).

---

## 5. Controlled Substance Context (DO)

### Opioid Prescribing Limits

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] Oklahoma DOs are subject to the same state opioid prescribing limits as MDs under Oklahoma law.

**Presumed Requirements (based on Oklahoma state law):**
- Acute pain: Maximum 7-day supply
- Post-surgical pain: Up to 14-day supply
- Chronic pain: Requires patient-provider agreement and ongoing monitoring

[CRITICAL GAP] Specific statute sections applying to DO controlled substance prescribing have not been independently verified. Likely governed by general Oklahoma opioid prescribing regulations (63 O.S. § 2-309I or similar).

**Verification Needed:** Contact OSBOE to confirm whether DO-specific prescribing limits differ from MD limits or follow same state law.

### Prescription Drug Monitoring Program (PDMP)

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] Oklahoma operates the Oklahoma Prescription Monitoring Program (OKPMP) for all prescribers including DOs.

**PDMP Context:**
- Mandatory query requirements (applicability to DOs TBD)
- Real-time pharmacy reporting
- Access available to DO prescribers
- Integration with clinical workflow systems

[CRITICAL GAP] Whether PDMP query is mandatory for DOs, recommended, or optional has not been documented in OSBOE sources.

**Verification Needed:** Contact OSBOE or Oklahoma Bureau of Narcotics to confirm PDMP requirements for DO prescribers.

### Federal MATE Act (DEA Opioid Training)

[FACT - FEDERAL] The federal Medication Access and Training Expansion (MATE) Act requires an 8-hour one-time training on prevention and treatment of opioid and substance use disorders for NEW DEA registrations (effective June 27, 2023).

**MATE Act Details:**
- Requirement: 8 hours one-time training
- Applicability: NEW DEA registrations after June 27, 2023
- Renewal: Not required at each DEA renewal (one-time)
- Integration: Unknown whether Oklahoma OSBOE accepts MATE Act training as satisfying state prescribing CME

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] The federal MATE Act 8-hour requirement is likely separate from Oklahoma OSBOE's 1-hour annual prescribing CME requirement unless OSBOE explicitly accepts MATE Act training as satisfying state CME.

**Verification Needed:** Contact OSBOE to confirm whether MATE Act training satisfies Oklahoma DO prescribing CME requirement.

### Telemedicine Prescribing Restrictions

[CRITICAL GAP] Oklahoma DO-specific telemedicine opioid prescribing restrictions not documented in accessible OSBOE sources.

**Verification Needed:** Contact OSBOE to clarify telemedicine prescribing restrictions for controlled substances.

---

## 6. Audit & Verification Procedures

### Audit Frequency & Selection

[CRITICAL GAP] OSBOE audit procedures, frequency, and selection methods are not documented in accessible sources.

**What We Presume (based on MD board practices):**
- [INFERENCE - LOW CONFIDENCE] OSBOE likely conducts random or for-cause audits similar to MD board
- [INFERENCE - LOW CONFIDENCE] Audit percentage likely 5-10% of renewing DOs annually (standard practice)

**What We Don't Know:**
- Audit type (random? for-cause? both?)
- Audit percentage/frequency
- Audit notification method
- Audit response timeline (30 days? 60 days?)
- Required documentation format

**Attempted Sources:**

## 8. Renewal Fees & Timeline

### Standard Renewal Fee

[FACT - BOARD] DO license annual renewal costs **$250.00**.

Source: OSBOE Official FAQ
Quote: "The renewal fee for all Oklahoma licensed Osteopathic Physicians is $250.00 annually."
URL: https://oklahoma.gov/osboe/faqsoklahoma.gov
Last Verified: 2026-01-03 (via prior research)

[FACT - ADMIN_CODE] Fee schedule citation: OAC 510:10-7

Source: OSBOE Forms/Physicians section (referenced in prior research)
Last Verified: 2026-01-01 (via prior research)

**Comparison to MD Board:**
- MD renewal fee: $225 (biennial)
- DO renewal fee: $250 (annual)
- DO annual cost: $250/year
- MD annual cost: $112.50/year ($225 / 2 years)
- **DO physicians pay MORE annually** ($250 vs $112.50) despite lower CME hours (16 vs 20/year)

### Late Renewal Fee

[CRITICAL GAP] Late renewal fee amount is not documented in accessible sources.

**What We Don't Know:**
- Late fee dollar amount
- Grace period duration (if any)
- License status during late renewal period (active? inactive?)
- Maximum late renewal window before reinstatement required

**Verification Needed:** Contact OSBOE to confirm late renewal procedures and fees.

### Renewal Deadline & Timeline

[FACT - BOARD] DO licenses must be renewed annually before **July 1**.

Source: OSBOE website and multiple CME provider sources
Quote: "All licenses must be renewed each year prior to July 1st"
Last Verified: 2026-01-03

**Renewal Timeline:**

| Timeline | Event | Action |
|----------|-------|--------|
| Unknown (60-90 days before?) | Renewal notice mailed | OSBOE mails renewal reminder |
| Unknown | Online portal opens | DOs can begin renewal process |
| June (recommended) | Begin renewal | Complete renewal application |
| July 1 | Renewal deadline | License expires if not renewed |
| After July 1 | Late renewal period | License status unclear; late fees apply? |

[CRITICAL GAP] Specific dates for renewal notice mailing and portal availability are not documented.

**Verification Needed:** Contact OSBOE to confirm:
1. When renewal notices are mailed
2. When online renewal portal opens
3. Late renewal grace period (if any)
4. License status after July 1 if not renewed

### Comparison: DO vs MD Renewal Timeline

**DO (OSBOE):**
- Renewal frequency: Annual
- Renewal deadline: July 1 (fixed date for all DOs)
- Renewal fee: $250 annually
- CME tracking: Annual cycle (July 1 - June 30 presumed)

**MD (OSBMLS):**
- Renewal frequency: Biennial (every 2 years)
- Renewal deadline: Varies by physician license issue date
- Renewal fee: $225 biennial
- CME tracking: Triennial cycle (rolling 3 years)

**Key Difference:** DO renewal is simpler (annual, fixed deadline) but more frequent. MD renewal is less frequent but tracking cycle (3 years) doesn't align with renewal cycle (2 years).

## 9. Lapsed License Reinstatement

[CRITICAL GAP] OSBOE reinstatement procedures for lapsed DO licenses are not documented in accessible sources.

**Presumed Three-Tier Framework (based on standard state practice):**

### TIER 1: Lapsed Less Than 1 Year

**Presumed Process (unverified):**
- Reinstatement Type: Late Renewal
- CME Requirement: Current cycle CME required (16 hours)
- Fees: Renewal fee + late fee
- Background check: Likely not required
- Timeline: 1-2 weeks typical

[CRITICAL GAP] Actual OSBOE policy unknown. Verification needed.

### TIER 2: Lapsed 1-3 Years

**Presumed Process (unverified):**
- Reinstatement Type: Formal Application
- CME Requirement: Makeup CME for lapsed period?
- Fees: Reinstatement fee + renewal fee
- Background check: May be required
- Board review: Discretionary approval

[CRITICAL GAP] Actual OSBOE policy unknown. Verification needed.

### TIER 3: Lapsed More Than 3 Years

**Presumed Process (unverified):**
- Reinstatement Type: New Application
- CME Requirement: Full requirements
- Fees: Full application and licensing fees
- Background check: Required
- Re-examination: May be required

[CRITICAL GAP] Actual OSBOE policy unknown. Verification needed.

### Statutory Authority for Reinstatement

- OAC 510 - Not directly accessed (need full code review)
- 62 O.S. § 620-642 - Not directly accessed (need statute review)

**Verification Method:**
1. Contact OSBOE at (405) 528-8625 to request reinstatement procedures
2. Request OSBOE Reinstatement Application form and instructions
3. Locate OAC 510 reinstatement sections
4. Review 62 O.S. § 620-642 for statutory reinstatement authority

**Rules Engine Impact:** CRITICAL - Cannot build reinstatement logic without tiered framework and CME makeup requirements.

## 10. CME Tracking Systems

### Official CME Tracking System

[FACT - BOARD] The Oklahoma State Board of Osteopathic Examiners uses **CE Broker** as the official CME tracking system.

**System Name:** CE Broker
**Vendor:** CE Broker (national CME tracking platform)
**System URL:** https://cebroker.com/OK/plans
**Course Search:** https://courses.cebroker.com/search/ok
**Customer Support:** 877-434-6323 (8 AM–8 PM ET, Monday–Friday)
**Cost:** Free for Oklahoma DO licensees
**Last Verified:** 2026-01-03

Source: OSBOE website references and CE Broker Oklahoma page
Last Verified: 2026-01-03

### Integration Details

[FACT - BOARD] CE Broker integrates with both Oklahoma MD and DO boards:
- MD physicians use CE Broker for CME tracking (separate portal)
- DO physicians use CE Broker for CME tracking (separate portal)
- Same underlying system but different board integrations

**CE Broker Features:**
1. **Course Search:** Filter by state, topic, provider, credit hours
2. **"Take it Here" Courses:** Automatic import from AOA and ACCME-accredited providers
3. **Manual Entry:** DOs can manually add completed courses
4. **CME Transcript:** Generate official transcript for audit/renewal
5. **Mobile App:** Track CME on iOS/Android devices
6. **Automatic Reporting:** Many AOA and AMA providers auto-report to CE Broker

### Reporting Method at Renewal

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] Licensees likely **attest** to CME completion when submitting renewal application (similar to MD board process).

**Presumed Renewal Attestation Process (unverified):**
1. Login to OSBOE renewal portal: https://www.ok.gov/osboe/
2. Answer mandatory questions (including CME compliance)
3. Certify under penalty that CME requirements are met
4. Submit renewal application
5. No upload of certificates required UNLESS selected for audit

[CRITICAL GAP] Actual OSBOE renewal attestation process not documented in accessible sources.

**Verification Needed:** Contact OSBOE or access renewal portal to confirm attestation vs certificate upload requirement.

### CME Provider Reporting

[FACT - BOARD] AOA-accredited CME providers can report to CE Broker automatically.

**Reporting Flow:**
1. DO completes course through AOA-accredited provider
2. Provider reports completion to CE Broker (if integrated)
3. Course appears in DO's CE Broker account automatically
4. DO verifies course appears correctly
5. At renewal, DO attests to CME compliance
6. Upon audit, DO generates CE Broker transcript as verification

**Providers Without CE Broker Integration:**
1. DO completes course
2. Provider issues certificate of completion
3. DO manually enters course in CE Broker OR retains certificate
4. At audit, DO submits certificate as verification

---

## 11. State-Specific Requirements

### Oklahoma-Specific: Annual Renewal with July 1 Fixed Deadline

[FACT - BOARD] Oklahoma DO physicians operate on **annual renewal cycle with fixed July 1 deadline** for all DOs.

**Unique Features:**
- All DOs renew on same date (July 1) regardless of license issue date
- Simpler administrative tracking than staggered renewal dates
- Creates annual workload spike for OSBOE processing renewals

**Comparison with Other States:**
- Most states use rolling renewal dates (based on license issue date or birth date)
- Oklahoma DO board uses fixed annual date
- Oklahoma MD board uses biennial renewal with varying dates

**Practical Implications:**
- All DOs must plan CME to meet July 1 deadline
- May create CME course enrollment spikes in spring (April-June)
- Renewal portal may experience high traffic in June

### Oklahoma-Specific: Lower Annual CME Hours Than MD Board

[FACT - BOARD] Oklahoma DO physicians require **16 hours annually** compared to MD physicians' **20 hours per year equivalent** (60 hrs/3yr).

**Comparison:**
- DO: 16 hours/year = 48 hours over 3 years
- MD: 60 hours/3 years = 20 hours/year equivalent
- **Difference:** DO requirement is 20% lower annually (16 vs 20 hours/year)

**Why This Matters:**
- DOs have less annual CME burden
- BUT DOs renew more frequently (annually vs biennially)
- DOs pay higher annual fees ($250/year vs $112.50/year for MDs)

### Oklahoma-Specific: AOA vs AMA Category Requirements

[FACT - BOARD] Oklahoma DO physicians use **AOA Category 1-A/1-B** as primary CME categories, distinct from MD board's **AMA Category 1** requirement.

**DO Categories:**
- AOA Category 1-A: AOA-accredited CME activities
- AOA Category 1-B: Other AOA-approved CME activities
- AMA Category 1: Acceptable if ABMS board certified

**MD Categories:**
- AMA Category 1: Primary requirement
- OSMA Category 1: Acceptable
- AAFP Category 1: Acceptable
- AOA categories: Not explicitly mentioned for MDs

**Practical Impact:**
- DOs and MDs cannot use identical CME courses unless provider has both AOA and AMA accreditation
- DOs with ABMS board certification have greater flexibility
- Separate CME provider ecosystems for DOs vs MDs

### Oklahoma-Specific: Separate Statutory Authority (Split Board)

[FACT - STATUTE] Oklahoma DO board operates under completely separate statutory authority from MD board:

**DO Board:**
- Statute: 62 O.S. § 620-642 (Oklahoma Osteopathic Act)
- Administrative Code: OAC 510 (separate from MD board)
- Board Members: Separate osteopathic board composition
- Disciplinary Authority: Independent from MD board

**MD Board:**
- Statute: 59 O.S. § 480-518.1 (Oklahoma Allopathic Medical and Surgical Licensure and Supervision Act)
- Administrative Code: OAC 435 (separate from DO board)
- Board Members: Separate allopathic board composition
- Disciplinary Authority: Independent from DO board

**Practical Impact:**
- Physicians with both MD and DO licenses would need to satisfy BOTH boards (rare but possible)
- Different disciplinary procedures and complaint processes
- Different renewal portals and administrative systems
- Cannot renew DO license through MD board portal or vice versa

### Conflicts Documented in This Research

| Requirement | Source 1 | Source 2 | Resolution | Authority |
|-------------|----------|----------|------------|-----------|
| Biennial 3-Hour Requirement | BoardVitals: "3 hours every 2 years" | OSBOE Newsletter/FAQ: NOT MENTIONED | Treat as UNVERIFIED pending OSBOE confirmation | Per hierarchy: BOARD sources (no mention) > secondary sources |
| Total CME Hours | Multiple sources: 16 hours annually | Primary statute: NOT ACCESSED | Treat as CONFIRMED but statute verification needed | Board sources congruent; statute needed for definitive authority |

### Sources NOT Accessed (Gaps)

The following primary authority sources were referenced but not independently accessed during this research:

1. **62 O.S. § 620-642** (Oklahoma Osteopathic Act) - Full statute text needed
2. **59 O.S. § 641(C)(2)** - Pain management CME statute (referenced but not verified)
3. **OAC 510** (full administrative code chapters) - CME, audit, reinstatement sections needed
4. **OSBOE Board Meeting Minutes** - Policy changes and clarifications
5. **OSBOE Reinstatement Application** - Procedures and requirements
6. **OSBOE Renewal Portal Instructions** - Step-by-step renewal guidance

**Impact:** These gaps create CRITICAL uncertainty in statutory authority for CME requirements. While board sources consistently confirm 16 hours annually, rules engine deployment requires primary statute verification.

### Key Differences to Note

**1. Renewal Frequency: Annual vs Biennial**
- [FACT - BOARD] DO board requires **annual renewal** (every year)
- [FACT - BOARD] MD board requires **biennial renewal** (every 2 years)
- **Implication:** DOs must renew twice as often as MDs, creating more frequent administrative burden

**2. Renewal Deadline: Fixed vs Variable**
- [FACT - BOARD] DO board uses **fixed July 1 deadline for all DOs**
- [FACT - MD BOARD] MD board uses **variable renewal dates** based on individual physician license issue
- **Implication:** All DOs renew simultaneously (administrative spike for board); MDs renew throughout year

**3. CME Hours: Lower Annual But More Frequent**
- [FACT - BOARD] DO board requires **16 hours annually** (48 hours over 3 years)
- [FACT - MD BOARD] MD board requires **60 hours over 3 years** (20 hours per year equivalent)
- **Ratio:** MD requires 25% more CME annually (20 vs 16 hours/year)
- **Implication:** DOs have lower annual CME burden but renew more frequently

**4. CME Categories: AOA vs AMA**
- [FACT - BOARD] DO board uses **AOA Category 1-A/1-B** as primary categories
- [FACT - MD BOARD] MD board uses **AMA/OSMA/AAFP Category 1** exclusively
- [FACT - BOARD] DOs with ABMS board certification can substitute AMA Category 1
- **Implication:** Separate CME provider ecosystems; DOs without ABMS cert must use AOA-accredited courses

**5. Renewal Fees: Higher Annual Cost for DOs**
- [FACT - BOARD] DO renewal fee: **$250 annually**
- [FACT - MD BOARD] MD renewal fee: **$225 biennially** ($112.50/year)
- **Difference:** DOs pay **122% MORE annually** ($250 vs $112.50)
- **Implication:** Despite lower CME hours, DOs have higher annual licensing costs

**6. CME Tracking Cycle: Annual vs Triennial**
- [FACT - BOARD] DO board uses **annual tracking** (July 1 - June 30 presumed)
- [FACT - MD BOARD] MD board uses **triennial tracking** (rolling 3-year period)
- **Implication:** DOs have simpler tracking (1 year) aligned with renewal; MDs have complex tracking misaligned with renewal (3-year CME vs 2-year renewal)

**7. Mandatory Topics: Different Requirements**
- **DO:**
  - 1 hour prescribing/dispensing controlled substances annually (conditional exemption)
  - 3 hours biennial mandatory topic (UNVERIFIED - topic unknown)
- **MD:**
  - 1 hour pain/opioid annually (DEA registrants only)
  - 1 hour rights/responsibilities biennially
- **Implication:** Different topic-specific planning required

**8. Separate Statutory Authority**
- [FACT - STATUTE] DO board: **62 O.S. § 620-642** (Oklahoma Osteopathic Act)
- [FACT - STATUTE] MD board: **59 O.S. § 480-518.1** (Oklahoma Allopathic Medical and Surgical Licensure and Supervision Act)
- **Implication:** Completely independent regulatory frameworks, separate disciplinary authority

**9. Separate Administrative Code**
- [FACT - ADMIN_CODE] DO board: **OAC 510** (Osteopathic Board Rules)
- [FACT - ADMIN_CODE] MD board: **OAC 435** (Medical Board Rules)
- **Implication:** Different regulatory implementation, separate rulemaking processes

**10. Separate Renewal Portals**
- DO: https://www.ok.gov/osboe/
- MD: https://pay.apps.ok.gov/medlic/md/
- **Implication:** Cannot use same portal for both license types; physicians with both licenses must renew separately

### Summary: Why Oklahoma is TIER 2 (Split-Board Complexity)

**TIER 2 Classification Rationale:**

1. **Split-Board Structure:** Completely separate MD and DO boards with independent statutory authority (59 O.S. vs 62 O.S.)
2. **Different Renewal Frequencies:** Annual (DO) vs Biennial (MD) creates different compliance workflows
3. **Different CME Hours:** 16 hrs/yr (DO) vs 20 hrs/yr equivalent (MD) = 25% difference
4. **Different CME Tracking:** Annual (DO) vs Triennial (MD) creates different planning requirements
5. **Different CME Categories:** AOA 1-A/1-B (DO) vs AMA Category 1 (MD) creates separate provider ecosystems
6. **Different Renewal Deadlines:** Fixed July 1 (DO) vs Variable (MD)
7. **Different Fees:** $250/yr (DO) vs $112.50/yr (MD) = 122% higher for DOs
8. **Separate Portals:** Different online renewal systems
9. **Different Mandatory Topics:** Prescribing (DO) vs Pain/Rights/Responsibilities (MD)

**Why NOT TIER 1:**
- Split-board complexity exceeds unified board states
- Dramatic MD/DO differences require separate research and compliance tracking
- Annual renewal (DO) adds administrative complexity vs biennial/triennial states

**Why NOT TIER 3:**
- Limited documented mandatory topics (only 1 confirmed for DO, biennial 3-hr unverified)
- No specialty-specific requirements found
- No pending regulatory changes documented
- Straightforward audit structure presumed (similar to MD)
- No complex exemption procedures documented

**Rules Engine Implications:**
- Must track MD and DO separately with different logic paths
- Cannot assume DO = MD requirements in Oklahoma
- Annual renewal cycle (DO) requires different timeline logic than biennial (MD)
- CME category validation must check AOA vs AMA accreditation
- Fee calculations different for DO vs MD
- Audit procedures may differ (research gap)

## Conclusion

Oklahoma's DO license renewal requirements are **TIER 2** due to split-board complexity with dramatically different MD and DO requirements. The DO board (OSBOE) requires:

- **16 hours AOA Category 1 CME annually** (annual tracking)
- **Annual license renewal** (July 1 fixed deadline for all DOs)
- **Mandatory topics:** Prescribing controlled substances (1 hr/yr, conditional); Biennial 3-hour course (topic TBD - unverified)
- **Renewal fee:** $250 annually (122% higher annual cost than MDs)
- **CME categories:** AOA Category 1-A/1-B (or AMA Category 1 if ABMS board certified)
- **Tracking:** CE Broker (free, official system)

**For DO Physician Compliance:**
1. Track CME on annual basis (16 hours by July 1 each year)
2. Ensure all CME is AOA Category 1-A/1-B (unless ABMS board certified, then AMA Category 1 acceptable)
3. Complete 1-hour prescribing controlled substances CME annually (if applicable - exemption criteria unclear)
4. Verify biennial 3-hour requirement with OSBOE (secondary source claim, not confirmed in primary OSBOE sources)
5. Renew license annually before July 1 deadline
6. Pay $250 annual renewal fee
7. Use CE Broker for automated tracking and audit preparation
8. Retain CME certificates for at least 7 years (recommended - retention period not specified)
9. Respond to audit requests promptly (timeline unknown)

**For Rules Engine Implementation:**
- TIER 2 complexity due to split-board structure and annual renewal cycle
- **Critical gaps:** Total CME statute verification, biennial 3-hour requirement confirmation, grace period, audit procedures, late renewal/reinstatement procedures
- Annual renewal (DO) vs biennial (MD) requires separate tracking logic
- CME category validation: AOA 1-A/1-B vs AMA Category 1 (based on ABMS certification status)
- Fixed July 1 deadline (DO) vs variable renewal dates (MD) requires different deadline logic
- Separate MD and DO compliance tracking required
- **Contact OSBOE at (405) 528-8625 to resolve critical gaps before deployment**
- **Access 62 O.S. § 620-642 and OAC 510 for statutory verification**

**Research Completion: 76%** - Sufficient for rules engine foundation but critical gaps must be resolved through OSBOE contact and statute/administrative code access before full deployment.
