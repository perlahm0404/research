# Massachusetts MD License Renewal Requirements - Narrative Research

**Research Period:** January 2, 2026
**Tier Classification:** TIER-1 (Simple State with Multiple Mandatory Topics)
**Document Version:** 1.0
**Completion:** 89%

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Massachusetts requires physicians to complete 50 credits of CME per 2-year (biennial) renewal cycle, accepting either Category 1 or Category 2 credits. The state is notable for having **multiple mandatory topic requirements** including 10 hours risk management (highest among states), 3 hours opioid prescribing (if prescribes), 3 hours electronic health records, 2 hours board regulations, and one-time requirements for end-of-life care (2 hours), Alzheimer's disease, implicit bias (2 hours), child abuse/neglect, and domestic violence/sexual violence training. Massachusetts allows **physician burnout/wellness training to count toward risk management credit**, reflecting a progressive approach to physician well-being.

**Key Highlights:**
- **CME Requirement:** 50 credits per 2-year cycle (Category 1 or Category 2 accepted)
- **Risk Management:** 10 hours per cycle (mandatory, highest in nation)
- **Opioid Prescribing:** 3 hours per cycle (if prescribes controlled substances)
- **Electronic Health Records:** 3 hours per cycle
- **Board Regulations:** 2 hours per cycle (may apply to risk management)
- **One-Time Requirements:** End-of-life care (2 hrs), Alzheimer's (adult populations), implicit bias (2 hrs, June 1, 2022), child abuse/neglect, domestic violence/sexual violence
- **Complexity Score:** 5/10 (TIER-1 state with highest number of mandatory topics)

## CYCLE CALCULATION & MANDATORY TOPIC INTEGRATION

### Sample CME Breakdown for 2-Year Cycle

[FACT-CALCULATION] For a physician who prescribes controlled substances:

**Per-Cycle Mandatory Requirements:**
- Risk Management: 10 hours
- Opioid Prescribing: 3 hours (if prescribes)
- Electronic Health Records: 3 hours
- Board Regulations: 2 hours (may count toward risk management)

**Total Mandatory (without overlap):** 18 hours
**Total Mandatory (with board regs counting toward risk mgmt):** 16 hours

**Remaining Flexible CME:**
- If no overlap: 32 hours
- If board regs count toward risk mgmt: 34 hours

**First Renewal After Implementation (One-Time Add-Ons):**
- End-of-Life Care: 2 hours
- Implicit Bias: 2 hours
- Alzheimer's Disease: 1-2 hours (estimated)
- Child Abuse/Neglect: 2-3 hours (estimated)
- Domestic Violence/Sexual Violence: 2-3 hours (estimated)

**First Renewal Total:** 50 hours base + estimated 9-12 hours one-time = **59-62 hours** (exceeds base requirement, spillover may not count)

[CRITICAL GAP] **Status:** Whether one-time requirements **count toward the 50-credit base** or are **additional** is unclear.
- **Assumption:** Likely count toward base, meaning first renewal requires careful planning to fit all mandatory topics within 50 credits
- **Next Step:** Board contact

- Renewal deadline: **Varies by licensee** (assigned at initial licensure)
- CME period: **50 credits completed within the 2-year period ending on renewal date**

[CRITICAL GAP] **Status:** Grace period mechanics, late fees, and renewal fee amounts **not documented** in publicly available materials.
- **Next Step:** Board contact or online renewal portal review

### New Licensee Provisions

[CRITICAL GAP] **Status:** Whether new licensees have **reduced CME requirements** for their first renewal cycle **not documented**.
- **Assumption:** Likely pro-rated based on months licensed, but requires confirmation
