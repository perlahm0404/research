## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### Overall Status: **STRONG FOUNDATION WITH QUALITY VARIANCE**

**Research has achieved remarkable breadth with 61 completed documents covering 55 MD jurisdictions and 6 split-board DO jurisdictions.** The corpus represents approximately **2 months of intensive research** and provides a solid foundation for rules engine development. However, quality variance exists across documents, with completion percentages not always accurately reflecting document depth.

### Key Metrics

| Metric | Value | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|
| **Total Documents Completed** | 61 | ✅ Excellent coverage |
| **MD Jurisdictions Complete** | 55 of 56 | ✅ 98% complete |
| **DO Split-Board Research** | 6 of 12 identified | 🟡 50% complete |
| **Average Document Length** | 601 lines | ✅ Substantial depth |
| **Document Length Range** | 176 - 1,250 lines | 🔴 7.1x variance |
| **Average Completion %** | 86% (claimed) | 🟡 May be inflated |
| **Tier Distribution** | T1: 37, T2: 18, T3: 6 | ✅ Balanced coverage |

   - Hawaii expanded to 839 lines, now truly comprehensive (85% accurate)
   - Calibration improved for expanded v3.0 documents

3. **Evidence citation variance:**
   - Range: 15 citations (Indiana) to 128 citations (Hawaii)
   - Average: ~60 citations per document
   - Documents under 40 citations may be less comprehensive

4. **Systematic gaps across multiple documents:**
   - CME tracking system details (CE Broker vs other)
   - Audit frequency percentages (board discretion, not published)
   - Board certification exemption details
   - Military/hardship exemption procedures
   - Exact renewal fee amounts (some states don't publish online)

#### 🔴 **ACTION ITEMS: Remaining Work**

1. **MD Research Pending:**
   - South Dakota (marked complete in tracker but only 497 lines)
   - All other 55 MD jurisdictions documented

2. **DO Research Pending (6 of 12 split-board states):**
   - Remaining: Maine, Michigan, Nevada, Oklahoma, Washington, West Virginia
   - Identified but not yet researched as separate deliverables

3. **NP Research:**
   - 0 of 56 jurisdictions researched (separate license type)
   - Requires Board of Nursing research (different regulatory framework)

4. **Quality improvement opportunities:**
   - 2 documents under 300 lines need expansion
   - 32 documents in 300-599 line range may benefit from audit/tracking sections
   - Standardize completion percentage calibration

## 1. COMPLETENESS ANALYSIS

### 1.1 Research Coverage by License Type

#### MD (Allopathic Physicians) - Primary Focus

**Completed:** 55 of 56 jurisdictions (98%)

**Breakdown by Tier:**

| Tier | Total Eligible | Complete | Pending | % Complete |
|------|---------------|----------|---------|------------|
| TIER-1 (Simple States) | 37 | 37 | 0 | 100% |
| TIER-2 (Split-Board/Complex) | 12 | 12 | 0 | 100% |
| TIER-3 (High Complexity) | 6 | 6 | 0 | 100% |
| Territories | 3 | 3 | 0 | 100% |
| **TOTAL** | **56** | **55** | **1** | **98%** |

**Pending MD Research:**
- None! All 50 states + DC + 3 territories complete for MD

**Note:** South Dakota marked complete but document quality may need review (497 lines, mid-range).

#### DO (Osteopathic Physicians) - Split-Board States Only

**Completed:** 6 of 12 identified split-board states (50%)

**Split-Board States Identified:**

| State | MD Status | DO Status | Comparison Table |
|-------|-----------|-----------|------------------|
| Arizona | ✅ Complete (696 lines) | ✅ Complete (747 lines) | ✅ Present |
| California | ✅ Complete (829 lines) | ✅ Complete (996 lines) | ✅ Present |
| Florida | ✅ Complete (915 lines) | ✅ Complete (1,002 lines) | ✅ Present |
| Maine | ✅ Complete (721 lines) | ❌ Pending | ❌ |
| Michigan | ✅ Complete (670 lines) | ❌ Pending | ❌ |
| Nevada | ✅ Complete (758 lines) | ❌ Pending | ❌ |
| Oklahoma | ✅ Complete (1,250 lines) | ❌ Pending | ❌ |
| Pennsylvania | ✅ Complete (1,156 lines) | ✅ Complete (1,008 lines) | ✅ Present |
| Tennessee | ✅ Complete (607 lines) | ✅ Complete (728 lines) | ✅ Present |
| Vermont | ✅ Complete (495 lines) | ✅ Complete (605 lines) | ✅ Present |
| Washington | ✅ Complete (307 lines) | ❌ Pending | ❌ |
| West Virginia | ✅ Complete (359 lines) | ❌ Pending | ❌ |

**Remaining DO Research Needed:**
- Maine DO (ME-O)
- Michigan DO (MI-O)
- Nevada DO (NV-O)
- Oklahoma DO (OK-O) - **CRITICAL**: Tracker notes dramatic MD/DO difference (60/3yr vs 16/yr)
- Washington DO (WA-O)
- West Virginia DO (WV-O)

**Estimated Effort:** 8-10 hours per state × 6 states = **48-60 hours** to complete all DO research

#### NP (Nurse Practitioners) - Not Yet Started

**Completed:** 0 of 56 jurisdictions (0%)

**Status:** NP research requires completely separate regulatory framework research:
- Regulated by State Boards of Nursing (not medical boards)
- Different CME structures and requirements
- Some states: RN license + NP certification (dual renewal)
- Estimated effort: 6-8 hours per state × 56 = **336-448 hours**

**Priority:** Lower priority than MD/DO completion; NP research is Phase 2

### 1.2 Document Completion Percentage Distribution

**Self-Reported Completion Percentages:**

| Completion Range | Count | % of Corpus | Examples |
|-----------------|-------|-------------|----------|
| 95-100% | 1 | 2% | Alabama (634 lines) |

| 85-89% | 42 | 69% | Most states (TIER-1 through TIER-3) |
| 80-84% | 5 | 8% | AZ, FL, VT, NY, TN |
| 75-79% | 3 | 5% | AZ-DO, CA-DO, FL-DO |
| **Average** | **86%** | — | Across all 61 documents |

**Analysis:**
- Heavy clustering at 85% (69% of documents) suggests standardization
- Expanded v3.0 documents (GA, HI, ID, KS, KY) moved from "stub" to comprehensive 85%
- Split-board DO documents cluster at 76-84% (acknowledging higher complexity)

## 3. GAP ANALYSIS

### 3.1 Systematic Gaps Across Documents

**Critical Gaps Identified (Affecting Multiple States):**

#### Gap Category: Audit & Verification Procedures

**Affected Documents:** ~30% of corpus (18 documents)

**What's Missing:**
- Specific audit percentage (e.g., "5% of licensees audited annually")
- Random vs for-cause audit distinction
- Audit response timeline (e.g., "30 days to submit certificates")
- Documentation retention period
- Penalties for audit non-compliance

**Why Missing:**
- Many state boards do not publish audit percentages publicly
- Audit procedures left to board discretion
- Internal administrative procedures not codified in statute/admin code

**Impact on Rules Engine:** 🟡 **MEDIUM**
- Core compliance calculations not affected
- User audit risk assessment limited
- Cannot build "audit preparation" workflow without this data

**Resolution Strategy:**
1. Board contact via phone/email to request audit policies
2. FOIA requests for board meeting minutes discussing audit procedures
3. Review board annual reports (sometimes include audit statistics)

**Estimated Effort:** 1-2 hours per state × 18 states = **18-36 hours**

---

#### Gap Category: CME Tracking System Integration

**Affected Documents:** ~30% of corpus (18 documents)

**What's Missing:**
- Official CME tracking system name (CE Broker vs board portal vs other)
- Auto-reporting vs manual entry requirements
- Licensee portal URL and features
- Provider integration details (which CME providers auto-report)

**Why Missing:**
- Not all states use named third-party systems (CE Broker)
- Board portals vary in sophistication
- Integration details not published in statutes/admin codes

**Impact on Rules Engine:** 🟡 **MEDIUM-HIGH**
- Manual CME entry vs auto-sync affects user experience
- Cannot build CE Broker integration without knowing which states use it
- Affects "CME transcript import" feature prioritization

**Resolution Strategy:**
1. Test board renewal portals directly (create account, explore features)
2. Contact boards to ask "What CME tracking system do you use?"
3. Review CME provider websites (ACCME, AOA) for state integration lists

**Estimated Effort:** 1 hour per state × 18 states = **18 hours**

---

#### Gap Category: Board Certification Exemptions

**Affected Documents:** ~40% of corpus (24 documents)

**What's Missing:**
- ABMS board certification: Full exemption vs partial credit?
- AOA board certification: Accepted for DOs only or for all physicians?
- Certification vs recertification (MOC): Does maintaining cert exempt from CME?
- Which specialty boards qualify?
- Do topic-specific mandates (opioid CME, etc.) still apply?

**Why Missing:**
- Exemption policies sometimes in administrative rules, not statutes
- Board certification policies updated periodically, not always codified
- Some states explicitly state "no exemption" (California, others)

**Impact on Rules Engine:** 🟢 **LOW-MEDIUM**
- Affects "Are you board certified?" eligibility question
- Minority of physicians are board certified (though growing)
- Not blocking for MVP, but important for full compliance accuracy

**Resolution Strategy:**
1. Search administrative codes for "board certification" + "exemption"
2. Contact boards directly: "Does ABMS certification exempt from CME?"
3. Review FSMB state profiles (sometimes documents exemptions)

**Estimated Effort:** 1 hour per state × 24 states = **24 hours**

---

#### Gap Category: Reinstatement Procedures

**Affected Documents:** ~25% of corpus (15 documents)

**What's Missing:**
- Lapsed license reinstatement CME requirements (makeup for lapsed period?)
- Re-examination requirements (USMLE/COMLEX again if lapsed >X years?)
- Background check requirements
- Reinstatement fees
- Processing timeline

**Why Missing:**
- Reinstatement often in separate statutes (not renewal requirements)
- May require formal board application, not documented online
- Procedures vary by lapse duration

**Impact on Rules Engine:** 🟡 **MEDIUM**
- Affects "lapsed license" workflows
- Important for physicians returning to practice
- Not critical for active license renewals (90%+ of users)

**Resolution Strategy:**
1. Search state statutes for "reinstatement" + "inactive license"
2. Review board forms (often have "reinstatement application" PDFs)
3. Contact boards for reinstatement policy summary

**Estimated Effort:** 1.5 hours per state × 15 states = **22.5 hours**

---

#### Gap Category: Grace Periods & Late Fees

**Affected Documents:** ~20% of corpus (12 documents)

**What's Missing:**
- Exact grace period duration (30 days? 60 days? 90 days?)
- Late renewal fee amount ($50? $200? Percentage of renewal fee?)
- License status during grace period (active? inactive? suspended?)
- Automatic revocation date after grace period expires

**Why Missing:**
- Grace period policies in administrative rules, not always statutes
- Fee schedules updated periodically, not always published online
- Some states have no grace period (immediate expiration)

**Impact on Rules Engine:** 🟡 **MEDIUM**
- Affects renewal deadline urgency messaging
- Late fee calculation important for cost transparency
- "Can I still practice after expiration?" user question

**Resolution Strategy:**
1. Search administrative codes for "late renewal" + "grace period"
2. Review board fee schedules (PDF downloads on board websites)
3. Test board renewal portals (sometimes show fees during renewal)

**Estimated Effort:** 1 hour per state × 12 states = **12 hours**

---

### 3.2 Critical Gaps That Block Rules Engine Deployment

**Status:** ✅ **ZERO BLOCKING GAPS IDENTIFIED**

All 61 documents successfully capture the minimum data required for rules engine MVP:
- Total CME hours per cycle
- Renewal frequency
- Category 1 minimum requirements
- Mandatory topic hours
- Renewal deadlines

**Validation:** Rules engine can calculate compliance for all 55 MD jurisdictions based on current research.

### 3.3 High-Priority Gaps Affecting Compliance Validation

**Identified:** 4 gap categories affecting ~30% of documents

| Gap Category | States Affected | Impact | Estimated Effort |
|--------------|----------------|--------|------------------|

- **All CME must be Category 1:** 32 states (57%)
- **Minimum Category 1 (20-50% of total):** 22 states (39%)
- **No category restriction:** 2 states (4%)

### 4.2 Outliers and Unique State Features

**Document Length Outliers:**
- **Shortest:** Delaware MD (176 lines) - claimed 91% but missing sections
- **Longest:** Oklahoma MD (1,250 lines) - TIER-2 split-board comprehensive

**CME Hour Outliers:**
- **Highest Total:** Pennsylvania, New Hampshire, New Jersey (100 hrs/2yr)
- **Lowest Total:** South Dakota, Indiana, Montana, New York (no set hours)
- **Unique Flexible System:** Kansas (annual/biennial/triennial options)

**Unique State Requirements (Not Found Elsewhere):**

1. **Hawaii:** Strict Category 1/1-A ONLY (no Category 2 allowed) - most restrictive in nation
2. **Kansas:** Flexible renewal cycles (physician chooses annual, biennial, or triennial)
3. **New York:** No total hours, topic-specific only (child abuse, infection control, pain mgmt)
4. **Illinois:** 3-year + 6-year sub-cycles for mandatory topics (complex timing)
5. **California:** 12-hour pain management CME (one-time, highest pain mgmt requirement)
6. **Puerto Rico:** Multiple specialty-specific mandates (Dengue, Zika, dengue, obesity, cardiovascular, autism)
7. **Florida:** "Delinquent cycle" system vs grace period (unique terminology)
8. **Alabama:** Professional boundaries course (2 hrs, deadline Dec 31 2025 - specific one-time mandate)
9. **Texas:** Formal vs informal CME balance (24 formal, 24 informal)
10. **Oklahoma:** Dramatic MD/DO split (60/3yr for MD vs 16/yr for DO)

### 4.3 Tier Classification Accuracy Validation

**TIER-1 States (Simple, Unified Board):**
- ✅ **Correctly Classified:** 35 of 37
- 🟡 **Potential Reclassification:**
  - Kansas (flexible cycles add complexity → TIER-2?)
  - Hawaii (strictest category requirement → TIER-2?)

**Verdict:** TIER-1 classification accurate for 95% of states.

**TIER-2 States (Split-Board or Moderate Complexity):**
- ✅ **Correctly Classified:** All 12 split-board states
- ✅ **Complexity Justified:** High total hours (PA: 100/2yr), split-board governance

**Verdict:** TIER-2 classification accurate 100%.

**TIER-3 States (High Complexity, Multiple Overlapping Requirements):**
- ✅ **Correctly Classified:** Illinois, New York, New Jersey, North Carolina, Texas, Puerto Rico
- **Complexity Validated:**
  - Illinois: 3-year + 6-year sub-cycles
  - New York: No total hours (topic-only structure)
  - Puerto Rico: Multiple specialty-specific mandates
  - Texas: Formal/informal balance + pending nutrition mandate

**Verdict:** TIER-3 classification accurate 100%.

### 4.4 Split-Board State Validation

**All 12 Split-Board States Identified:**

| State | MD Board | DO Board | Major Difference | Comparison Table |
|-------|----------|----------|------------------|------------------|

| Florida | Board of Medicine | Board of Osteopathic Medicine | Renewal dates (birthday vs March 31) | ✅ |
| Maine | Board of Licensure in Medicine | Board of Osteopathic Licensure | 40/2yr vs 100/2yr (2.5x difference!) | ❌ DO pending |
| Michigan | Board of Medicine | Board of Osteopathic Medicine | Category 1 mins differ (75 vs 60) | ❌ DO pending |
| Nevada | State Board of Medical Examiners | State Board of Osteopathic Medicine | 40/2yr vs 40/yr (MAJOR) | ❌ DO pending |
| Oklahoma | Board of Medical Licensure | Board of Osteopathic Examiners | 60/3yr vs 16/yr (DRAMATIC) | ❌ DO pending |
| Pennsylvania | State Board of Medicine | State Board of Osteopathic Medicine | Category types (AMA vs AOA 1-A) | ✅ |
| Tennessee | Board of Medical Examiners | Board of Osteopathic Examination | Category mix differs | ✅ |
| Vermont | Board of Medical Practice | Secretary of State OPR | Different agencies! | ✅ |
| Washington | Medical Commission | Board of Osteopathic Medicine | 200/4yr vs 150/3yr (different cycles) | ❌ DO pending |
| West Virginia | Board of Medicine | Board of Osteopathy | 50 vs 32 hrs (MD higher - unusual) | ❌ DO pending |

**Validated:** All split-board states correctly identified and flagged for separate research.

**Critical Finding:** Several split-board states have DRAMATIC differences between MD and DO requirements:
- **Nevada:** MD 40/2yr vs DO 40/yr (2x annual requirement for DOs)
- **Oklahoma:** MD 60/3yr vs DO 16/yr (different structures entirely)
- **Maine:** MD 40/2yr vs DO 100/2yr (2.5x for DOs!)
- **Washington:** MD 200/4yr vs DO 150/3yr (different cycle lengths)

**Recommendation:** Remaining 6 DO states should be research priority to capture these major differences.

Subject: CME Audit Procedures Request

Dear [Board Name],

I am researching CME compliance requirements for [State] physicians. Could you please provide the following information regarding CME audits:

1. What percentage of licensees are audited annually (random audits)?
2. How many days do physicians have to respond to an audit request?
3. How long must physicians retain CME certificates?
4. What are the penalties for audit non-compliance?

Thank you for your assistance.
```

**Estimated Response Rate:** 60-70% of boards will respond within 1-2 weeks

### 7.3 Medium-Term Actions (Next Month - January 24 - February 24, 2026)

**Action:**
- Search administrative codes for "board certification" + "continuing medical education"
- Contact boards: "Does ABMS board certification exempt from CME requirements?"
- Document: Full exemption, partial credit, or no exemption

**States to Research:** 24 states with unclear board cert exemption policies

#### 8. Create Automated Quality Audit Script ⏱️ 4-6 hours

**Script:** `audit-quality.sh`

**Checks:**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Check document line counts
for file in *-MD-*.md *-DO-*.md; do
  lines=$(wc -l < "$file")
  if [ $lines -lt 400 ]; then
    echo "⚠️ $file: Only $lines lines (minimum 400)"
  fi
done

# Check evidence citation counts
for file in *-MD-*.md *-DO-*.md; do
  citations=$(grep -c "\[FACT\|INFERENCE\|GAP" "$file")
  if [ $citations -lt 50 ]; then
    echo "⚠️ $file: Only $citations citations (minimum 50)"
  fi
done

# Check required sections
for section in "Audit & Verification" "CME Tracking" "Lapsed License"; do
  for file in *-MD-*.md *-DO-*.md; do
    if ! grep -q "## .*$section" "$file"; then
      echo "❌ $file: Missing section '$section'"
    fi
  done
done
```

**Run:** Monthly quality checks before marking states as "complete"

#### 9. Establish Peer Review Process ⏱️ 2 hours setup + ongoing

**Process:**
1. Before marking state "COMPLETE" in tracker, second reviewer spot-checks:
   - 3 random [FACT] statements (verify statute citations)
   - Line count meets minimum (400+ for TIER-1, 600+ for TIER-2/3)
   - All 15 sections present
   - Evidence citation count meets minimum (50+)

2. Peer reviewer signs off in tracker:
   ```csv
   state_abbr,md_status,peer_reviewed,peer_reviewer,peer_review_date
   AL,COMPLETE,YES,Researcher2,2026-01-02
   ```

**Benefit:** Catches quality issues before documents published to users

### 7.4 Long-Term Actions (Next Quarter - February - April 2026)

#### 10. NP Research Initiative (Phase 2) ⏱️ 336-448 hours (8-11 weeks)

**Scope:** All 56 jurisdictions (50 states + DC + 5 territories)

**Challenges:**
- Regulated by Boards of Nursing (different regulatory framework)
- RN license + NP certification (dual renewal in some states)
- Prescriptive authority tied to CME in some states

**Prioritization:**
1. High-population states first (CA, TX, FL, NY, PA, IL, OH)
2. States with active CREDMATE users (if analytics available)
3. Split-board nursing states (separate RN vs APRN boards)

**Estimated Effort:**
- Simple states (unified board, clear requirements): 6 hours each
- Complex states (split RN/APRN, prescriptive authority): 10 hours each
- Average: 7 hours × 56 = **392 hours total**

**Timeline:** 2-3 months with dedicated researcher

#### 11. Annual Regulatory Update Process ⏱️ Ongoing

**Frequency:**
- **TIER-1 states:** Review every 2 years
- **TIER-2 states:** Review annually
- **TIER-3 states:** Review every 6 months (higher change frequency)

**Process:**
1. Subscribe to state board email lists (regulation change notifications)
2. Check FSMB state profiles quarterly for updates
3. Monitor state legislative trackers (bills affecting CME requirements)
4. Update documents when changes identified
5. Version bump (v1.0.0 → v1.1.0 for minor updates, v2.0.0 for major)

**Estimated Effort:** 1-2 hours per state per year = **56-112 hours annually**

#### 12. Create Public-Facing Research Summary ⏱️ 8-12 hours

**File:** `STATE-CME-REQUIREMENTS-SUMMARY.md`

**Content:**
- One-page summary per state (for user-facing display)
- Key requirements only (total hours, mandatory topics, renewal cycle)
- No research gaps/limitations (those stay in internal narrative docs)
- Links to official board websites
- Last verified date

**Use Case:** CREDMATE user dashboard showing "Your state requires..."

**Example:**
```markdown
## California MD Requirements

- **Total CME:** 50 hours every 2 years
- **Category:** All must be AMA Category 1
- **Pain Management:** 12 hours (one-time)
- **Renewal:** By birth month, biennial
- **Fee:** $1,206 (includes CURES $30, Thompson $25)

Last verified: January 2, 2026

## 10. RISK ASSESSMENT

### 10.1 Data Quality Risks

#### Risk: Completion Percentages May Create False Confidence

**Severity:** 🟡 **MEDIUM**

**Issue:** Delaware claims 91% complete but only 176 lines, missing 4 sections.

**Impact:**
- Users may assume all "90%+ complete" states are comprehensive
- Stakeholders may think research is "done" when expansion needed
- Quality variance not immediately visible in tracker

**Mitigation:**
1. Update tracker with quality grades (A+, A, A-, B+, etc.)
2. Recalibrate completion percentages for documents under 400 lines
3. Add "document_quality_grade" column to tracker CSV

**Timeline:** 1 hour to implement

---

#### Risk: Regulatory Changes May Invalidate Research

**Severity:** 🟡 **MEDIUM**

**Issue:** CME requirements change via legislation/regulation updates.

**Examples:**
- Illinois maternal health equity CME (pending, target July 1 2026)
- Texas nutrition CME (SB 25, effective Sept 1 2025)
- Alabama professional boundaries course (deadline Dec 31 2025)
- New York child abuse training update (deadline April 1 2025)

**Impact:**
- Documents may become outdated within 6-12 months
- Users receive inaccurate compliance information
- Rules engine calculates incorrect requirements

**Mitigation:**
1. Subscribe to all 56 state board email lists (regulation updates)
2. Quarterly FSMB state profile checks
3. Version documents with "last_verified" dates
4. Annual review cycle for TIER-1, semi-annual for TIER-3

**Timeline:** Ongoing monitoring (2-3 hours per month)

---

#### Risk: Gaps May Affect User Trust

**Severity:** 🟢 **LOW-MEDIUM**

**Issue:** 30% of documents missing audit/tracking details.

**Impact:**
- Users ask "How often will I be audited?" - answer: "Board discretion, percentage not published"
- Users ask "Does my state use CE Broker?" - answer: "Unclear"
- Perception: "Research is incomplete"

**Mitigation:**
1. Board contact initiative to resolve gaps (38 hours estimated)
2. Transparent communication: "We've researched X, Y is not publicly available"
3. Mark gaps as "LOW PRIORITY" vs "CRITICAL" in UI

**Timeline:** 2-3 weeks to resolve high-priority gaps

---

### 10.2 Scope Risks

#### Risk: DO Research Only 50% Complete

**Severity:** 🟡 **MEDIUM**

**Issue:** 6 of 12 split-board DO states pending.

**Impact:**
- DO physicians in 6 states cannot use CREDMATE for compliance
- Dramatic MD/DO differences (Oklahoma, Nevada, Maine) not yet documented
- Split-board comparison tables incomplete

**Mitigation:**
1. Prioritize Oklahoma DO and Nevada DO (most dramatic differences)
2. Allocate 50 hours (1.25 weeks) to complete remaining 6 states
3. Add "DO_RESEARCH_PENDING" flag in UI for affected states

**Timeline:** 2 weeks to complete all 6 DO states

---

#### Risk: NP Research Not Started (0%)

**Severity:** 🟢 **LOW** (for current phase)

**Issue:** 56 NP jurisdictions not researched.

**Impact:**
- Nurse practitioners cannot use CREDMATE
- Different regulatory framework (Boards of Nursing)
- Estimated 392 hours (10 weeks) to complete all states

**Mitigation:**
1. NP research is Phase 2 (after MD/DO completion)
2. Prioritize high-population states (CA, TX, FL, NY) for NP first
3. Allocate dedicated researcher for 2-3 months

**Timeline:** Q2 2026 (April-June) for NP research phase

---

### 10.3 Operational Risks

#### Risk: No Peer Review Process

**Severity:** 🟡 **MEDIUM**

**Issue:** Single researcher completes documents, no second-check.

**Impact:**
- Errors in statute citations may go undetected
- Quality variance not caught before "COMPLETE" status
- User trust at risk if errors discovered in production

**Mitigation:**
1. Implement peer review checklist (3 random fact-checks per document)
2. Second reviewer verifies line count, citation count, section presence
3. Add "peer_reviewed" and "peer_reviewer" columns to tracker

**Timeline:** 2 hours to implement process
