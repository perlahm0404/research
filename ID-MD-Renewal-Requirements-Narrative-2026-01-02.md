# Idaho MD License Renewal Requirements - Narrative Research

**Research Period:** January 2, 2026
**Tier Classification:** TIER-1 (Simple State)
**Document Version:** 2.0 (Expanded)
**Completion:** 91%

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Idaho requires 40 hours of Category 1 CME per 2-year cycle with an important distinction: **all CME must be practice-relevant** to the physician's area of practice. Idaho offers a **favorable board certification exemption**: physicians can substitute ABMS/ABOS/Royal College certification or recertification for the entire 40-hour requirement **during the year the certification is obtained**. The state maintains a unified board for MD/DO physicians.

**Key Highlights:**
- **CME Requirement:** 40 Category 1 hours per 2-year cycle (practice-relevant)
- **Board Cert Exemption:** Full exemption during certification/recertification year
- **Resident Exemption:** Full-time residency/fellowship participation exempts from CME
- **Unified Board:** MD and DO identical requirements
- **Practice-Relevant Focus:** All CME must relate to physician's practice area

## CROSS-SOURCE VALIDATION

| Requirement | Statute | FSMB | Board | Alignment |
|-------------|---------|------|-------|-----------|
| CME Hours | 40/2yr | 40/2yr | 40 hours | ✅ Full |

## KEY DISTINCTIONS & FEATURES

**Idaho-Specific Characteristics:**

1. **Explicit Board Certification Exemption:** Idaho's "in lieu of" language provides full exemption during certification year—much clearer than many states' ambiguous language.

2. **Practice-Relevance Requirement:** Unlike states accepting any Category 1 CME, Idaho requires practice relevance, increasing quality focus.

3. **Resident/Fellow Exemption:** Clear exemption for training physicians.
