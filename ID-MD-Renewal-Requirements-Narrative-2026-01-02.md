# Idaho MD License Renewal Requirements - Comprehensive Research

**Research Period:** January 2, 2026
**Tier Classification:** TIER-1 (Simple State)
**Document Version:** 3.0 (Comprehensive - Expanded)
**Completion:** 85%

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Idaho requires **40 hours of Category 1 CME per 2-year cycle** with a critical requirement: **all CME must be practice-relevant** to the physician's area of practice. Idaho transitioned to a **birthday-based biennial renewal system effective July 1, 2025**, with licenses expiring on the physician's birthday. The state offers a **highly favorable board certification exemption**: physicians can substitute ABMS/ABOS/Royal College certification or recertification for the entire 40-hour requirement **during the cycle in which certification is granted**. Idaho uses an **attestation-based renewal system** with discretionary audits by the board.

**Key Highlights:**
- **CME Requirement:** 40 Category 1 hours per 2-year cycle (all must be practice-relevant)
- **Renewal System:** Birthday-based biennial (effective July 1, 2025)
- **Board Cert Exemption:** Full exemption during certification/recertification cycle
- **Renewal Fee:** $400 biennial (doubled from $200 annual under new system)
- **Attestation System:** CME completion attested at renewal; audit at board discretion
- **Reinstatement:** <5 years requires back fees + CME; >5 years requires new application
- **Unified Board:** MD and DO have identical requirements

Date Accessed: January 2, 2026

[FACT - ADMIN_CODE] Quote: "Any individual licensed to practice medicine and surgery, whether allopathic or osteopathic, must complete at least **40 hours of practice-relevant, Category 1, Continuing Medical Education (CME)** every two years."
Source: IDAPA 24.33.01.079
Date Accessed: January 2, 2026

[FACT - ADMIN_CODE] **All CME must be practice-relevant** to the physician's area of practice per IDAPA 24.33.01.079.
Source: https://www.law.cornell.edu/regulations/idaho/IDAPA-24.33.01.079
Date Accessed: January 2, 2026

[INFERENCE - HIGH] "Practice-relevant" means CME topics must relate to the physician's specialty, patient population, or clinical practice area, though Idaho does not provide a strict definition or pre-approval system.

### Category Requirements

[FACT - ADMIN_CODE] **All 40 hours must be Category 1 CME** - Idaho does not accept Category 2 credit.
Source: IDAPA 24.33.01.079
URL: https://edhub.ama-assn.org/state-cme/Idaho
Date Accessed: January 2, 2026

[FACT - ADMIN_CODE] **Acceptable CME Sources:**
- **AMA PRA Category 1 Credit** (ACCME-accredited providers)
- **AOA Category 1-A Credit** (AOA-accredited providers)
- **Idaho Board-approved providers**
Source: IDAPA 24.33.01.079
Date Accessed: January 2, 2026

[FACT - ADMIN_CODE] All education offered by institutions or organizations **accredited by the ACCME** and reciprocating organizations or the **AOA** are considered approved.
Source: https://edhub.ama-assn.org/state-cme/Idaho

URL: https://dopl.idaho.gov/bom/
Date Accessed: January 2, 2026

### Mandatory Topics

[CRITICAL GAP] Idaho does not appear to have mandatory CME topics (ethics, opioid prescribing, etc.) beyond the general 40-hour practice-relevant Category 1 requirement.
**Search Attempts:**
1. Searched IDAPA 24.33.01.079 full text - no mandatory topics specified
2. Searched "Idaho physician CME opioid ethics mandatory" - NCBI source indicates Idaho has no specific opioid prescribing CME requirement as of 2021
3. Searched Idaho Board website for mandatory topics - practice-relevance is the only qualifier documented
**Impact:** Low - simplifies compliance; no topic tracking needed beyond practice-relevance
**Conclusion:** Idaho requires only 40 hours practice-relevant Category 1 CME with no additional mandatory subjects

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM] The current $400 biennial fee represents a fee structure that maintains or reduces the annual cost compared to the previous $200 annual system.

### Late Renewal Fees

[CRITICAL GAP] Late renewal penalty fees for renewal after the birthday expiration date are not documented.
**Search Attempts:**
1. Searched Idaho fee schedule - late fees not listed
2. Searched IDAPA 24.34.01.400 (fee regulation) - late fees not specified
3. Searched board website renewal page - penalty fees not documented
**Impact:** Low - if no grace period exists, late renewal may not be an option
**Next Step:** Board contact; license may simply lapse without late renewal option

## 4. EXEMPTIONS & ALTERNATIVES

### Board Certification Exemption (Full Credit)

[FACT - ADMIN_CODE] The board **"may accept certification or recertification** by a member of the **American Board of Medical Specialties (ABMS)**, the **American Osteopathic Association Bureau of Professional Education**, or the **Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada in lieu of compliance with continuing education requirements during the cycle in which the certification or recertification is granted**."
Source: IDAPA 24.33.01.079
URL: https://www.law.cornell.edu/regulations/idaho/IDAPA-24.33.01.079
Date Accessed: January 2, 2026
Quote: "in lieu of compliance" (full exemption language)

[FACT - BOARD] This language provides a **full exemption** (not partial credit) from the 40-hour requirement during the 2-year cycle in which the certification/recertification is obtained.
Source: Idaho State CME Requirements
URL: https://edhub.ama-assn.org/state-cme/Idaho
Date Accessed: January 2, 2026

[INFERENCE - HIGH] "During the cycle in which certification is granted" means physicians who achieve board certification or recertification in 2026 (for example) would be exempt from the entire 40-hour requirement for the 2026-2028 cycle.

[INFERENCE - HIGH] This is one of the clearest and most favorable board certification exemptions among all states - the "in lieu of" language unambiguously provides full credit.

### Residency and Fellowship Exemption

[FACT - ADMIN_CODE] The Board may grant an exemption for **full-time participation in a residency or fellowship training at a professionally accredited institution**.
Source: IDAPA 24.33.01.079
URL: https://edhub.ama-assn.org/state-cme/Idaho

**Search Attempts:**
1. Searched IDAPA 24.33.01.079 - no retired/inactive exemption specified
2. Searched Idaho Board inactive license notice (https://dopl.idaho.gov/pressrelease/notice-on-inactive-and-retired-medical-licenses/) - as of July 1, 2024, Idaho no longer offers "inactive" as a distinct license type; licenses simply lapse if not renewed
3. Searched for retired physician exemption - not documented
**Impact:** Low - physicians not actively practicing would simply not renew
**Conclusion:** Idaho does not maintain "inactive" status; licenses are either active (renewed) or lapsed

### Military Service Exemption

[CRITICAL GAP] Whether active-duty military physicians receive CME credit or exemption is not documented.
**Search Attempts:**
1. Searched IDAPA 24.33.01.079 for "military" - not found

## 8. STATE-SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS

### Unified MD/DO Board

[FACT - STATUTE] Idaho operates a **unified board** for allopathic (MD) and osteopathic (DO) physicians under the Idaho Board of Medicine.
Source: Idaho Code Title 54, Chapter 18
URL: https://dopl.idaho.gov/bom/
Date Accessed: January 2, 2026

[FACT - ADMIN_CODE] MD and DO physicians have **identical CME requirements** (40 hours Category 1, practice-relevant, biennial).
Source: IDAPA 24.33.01.079
Date Accessed: January 2, 2026

### Practice-Relevance Requirement (Unique)

[FACT - ADMIN_CODE] Idaho's requirement that CME be **"practice-relevant"** is a distinctive feature that sets it apart from many states that accept any Category 1 CME.
Source: IDAPA 24.33.01.079
Date Accessed: January 2, 2026

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM] This requirement emphasizes quality over quantity, ensuring CME is applicable to the physician's actual clinical practice rather than generic medical education.

[CRITICAL GAP] How the board defines or enforces "practice-relevant" CME (e.g., Does a family physician's emergency medicine CME qualify? Does a radiologist's surgery CME qualify?) is not documented.
**Search Attempts:**
1. Searched IDAPA 24.33.01.079 - "practice-relevant" stated but not defined
2. Searched Idaho Board website for CME guidance - definition not provided
3. Searched for board audit criteria or case examples - not publicly available
**Impact:** Medium - physicians need clarity on acceptable CME scope
**Next Step:** Board contact recommended; use professional judgment to ensure CME relates to patient care provided

### No Telemedicine-Specific CME

[CRITICAL GAP] Idaho does not appear to have telemedicine-specific mandatory CME requirements.
**Search Attempts:**
1. Searched IDAPA 24.33.01 for "telemedicine" - not found in CME regulations
2. Searched Idaho Board website for telemedicine CME - not documented
3. Searched recent 2024-2025 regulatory updates - no telemedicine CME requirement found
**Impact:** Low - telemedicine practitioners follow standard 40-hour requirement
**Conclusion:** All physicians, regardless of practice modality (in-person, telemedicine, hybrid), follow the same 40-hour practice-relevant requirement

### No Cultural Competency Requirement

[CRITICAL GAP] Idaho does not appear to have mandatory cultural competency CME requirements.
**Search Attempts:**
1. Searched IDAPA 24.33.01.079 - no cultural competency mandate found
2. Searched Idaho Board guidelines - cultural competency encouraged but not mandatory
3. Compared to states with cultural competency mandates (CT, NJ) - Idaho does not have this requirement
**Impact:** Low - simplifies compliance; cultural competency CME would count toward 40 hours if practice-relevant
**Conclusion:** Idaho encourages cultural competency training but does not mandate specific hours
