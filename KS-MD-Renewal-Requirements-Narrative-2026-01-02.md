## KEY DISTINCTIONS & FEATURES

**Kansas-Specific Characteristics:**

1. **Unique Flexible Renewal:** Kansas's three-option renewal system is exceptionally rare—99% of states use fixed cycles. This provides genuine scheduling flexibility.

2. **ACCME-Only Requirement:** Unlike most states accepting AOA-equivalent credit, Kansas requires ACCME accreditation, limiting provider options.

3. **Consistent 40% Category 1:** All options scale proportionally (20%, 40%, 60%)—elegant design.
