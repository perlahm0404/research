# Indiana MD License Renewal Requirements - Comprehensive Research

## Executive Summary

The Indiana Medical Licensing Board regulates physicians in Indiana. Key requirements:

- **CME Requirement:** NO SET total hours required (one of only 4 states)
- **Topic-Specific Requirement:** 2 hours opioid prescribing/abuse (effective July 1, 2019)
- **Regulatory Approach:** Hybrid professional autonomy + targeted topic model
- **License Structure:** Unified MD/DO board
- **Unique Status:** Only no-hours state with single targeted topic requirement

---

## 1. Board Information & Regulatory Authority

### Official Board Information

[FACT - BOARD] The Indiana Medical Licensing Board (IN-MLB) is the official regulatory agency for physicians in Indiana. Website: https://www.in.gov/pla/medical-licensing-board/. (Per state-research-tracker.csv 2026-01-02)

[FACT - STATUTE] IN-MLB's authority derives from Indiana Code Title 25, Article 22.5 (Medical Licensing Board).

### Unified Board Structure

[FACT - BOARD] Indiana operates a **unified board** regulating both Medical Doctors (MD) and Doctors of Osteopathic Medicine (DO) under single regulatory framework through the Indiana Professional Licensing Agency (PLA).

### Primary Statutory Framework

[FACT - STATUTE] Indiana Code Title 25, Article 22.5 establishes licensing and continuing education requirements:
- IC 25-22.5-1: Medical Licensing Board establishment
- IC 25-22.5-6: Continuing Medical Education provisions

[FACT - ADMIN_CODE] Indiana Administrative Code (IAC) Title 844, Article 5 contains specific regulations for medical practice.

---

## 2. CME Requirements - NO SET Total Hours + One Topic

### Indiana's Unique Hybrid Approach

[FACT - FSMB] **Indiana does NOT require a set total number of CME hours for physicians.** This is documented in the FSMB State CME Requirements database (October 2025 update).

[FACT - FSMB] Indiana requires **2 hours of CME on opioid prescribing and/or abuse** starting July 1, 2019. This is the ONLY mandatory CME requirement in Indiana.

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] Indiana is one of only **4 states** with no total CME hour requirement:
1. **Indiana (IN)** - No hours; 2 hrs opioid only
2. Montana (MT) - No hours; no topics
3. South Dakota (SD) - No hours; no topics
4. New York (NY) - No hours; multiple topics

### Comparison with Other No-Hours States

| State | Total Hours | Topic Requirements | Model Type |
|-------|-------------|-------------------|------------|
| **Indiana** | **NO SET HOURS** | **2 hrs opioid only** | **Hybrid** |
| Montana | NO SET HOURS | None | Pure autonomy |
| South Dakota | NO SET HOURS | None | Pure autonomy |
| New York | NO SET HOURS | Multiple topics | Topic-specific |

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] Indiana represents a **unique hybrid model**:
- Professional autonomy for general CME (no total hours)
- Targeted public health intervention for opioid crisis (2 hrs)
- Minimal regulatory burden (single topic vs. NY's multiple)

---

## 3. Opioid Prescribing CME Requirement (2 Hours)

### Requirement Details

[FACT - FSMB] Starting **July 1, 2019**, Indiana physicians must complete **2 hours of continuing education on opioid prescribing and/or abuse**.

### Applicability Questions

[CRITICAL GAP] The scope of this requirement is not fully documented:

**Key Questions:**
1. **Who must complete?** All physicians? Only DEA registrants? Only active prescribers?
2. **Frequency:** One-time only? Every renewal cycle?
3. **Content specifics:** Prescribing guidelines? Abuse recognition? PDMP training?
4. **Category requirement:** Must be AMA Category 1?
5. **Exemptions:** Board certification? Retired? Non-prescribers?

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] Based on patterns in other states:
- **Likely applies to:** All physicians with DEA registration
- **Likely frequency:** Biennial (every renewal cycle)
- **Likely content:** CDC guidelines, PDMP use, abuse recognition
- **Likely category:** Category 1 formal CME

### Historical Context

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] Indiana's 2-hour opioid CME reflects targeted response to opioid epidemic:
- July 1, 2019 effective date aligns with national opioid crisis focus
- Minimal burden (2 hours) balances education with professional autonomy
- Targeted requirement rather than comprehensive CME overhaul

---

## 4. Federal Requirements (Apply Regardless of State)

### DEA MATE Act Requirement (Effective June 27, 2023)

[FACT - FEDERAL] The federal **Medication Access and Training Expansion (MATE) Act** requires physicians with DEA registration to complete **8 hours of training on opioid or substance use disorders** (one-time).

**MATE Act vs. Indiana Opioid CME:**

| Requirement | Hours | Frequency | Authority |
|-------------|-------|-----------|-----------|
| **Indiana Opioid CME** | 2 hrs | Likely biennial | State |
| **Federal MATE Act** | 8 hrs | One-time | Federal (DEA) |

[CRITICAL - TWO SEPARATE REQUIREMENTS] Indiana's 2-hour requirement does **NOT** satisfy the federal 8-hour MATE Act (and vice versa). DEA-registered Indiana physicians must complete BOTH.

**Total Opioid-Related CME for Indiana DEA Prescribers:**
- 2 hours - Indiana state (likely biennial)
- 8 hours - Federal MATE Act (one-time)
- = 10 hours total initially, then 2 hours per renewal

---

## 5. Philosophical Foundation: Why This Hybrid Approach?

### Regulatory Philosophy

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] Indiana's approach reflects:

1. **Professional autonomy as default** - Trust physicians to self-direct learning
2. **Targeted intervention for crisis** - Opioid epidemic requires response
3. **Minimal regulatory burden** - 2 hours is practical and symbolic
4. **Political compromise** - Between no-regulation and public health advocates
5. **Administrative efficiency** - Small focused requirement easier to track

### Advantages

- Addresses specific public health crisis
- Maintains professional autonomy for general CME
- Minimal burden on physicians and board
- Flexibility for relevant learning

### Disadvantages

- No verification of general competency maintenance
- Only addresses one topic - other gaps may exist
- Minimal requirement may be insufficient for behavior change

---

## 6. What Indiana Physicians Must Do vs. Should Do

### Minimum Requirements (Must Do)

1. ✅ Complete 2-hour opioid prescribing/abuse CME (if applicable)
2. ✅ Complete federal MATE Act 8 hours (if DEA registered)
3. ✅ Renew license on time
4. ✅ Attest to professional competency

### Recommended Best Practices (Should Do)

1. Track 40-50 hours CME annually for professional development
2. Maintain CME certificates for hospital credentialing
3. Participate in quality improvement programs
4. Stay current with medical literature
5. Consider board certification maintenance (MOC)

### What Indiana Physicians Are NOT Required To Do

Unlike most states, Indiana physicians are **NOT required** to:
- Track total CME hours
- Obtain specific Category 1 credits
- Complete multiple mandatory topics
- Upload comprehensive CME certificates
- Use CME tracking systems like CE Broker
- Calculate carryover hours

---

## 7. Multi-State Licensure Implications

### Indiana in Multi-State Portfolio

**Example Scenario:**
Physician licensed in Indiana, Illinois, Ohio:
- **Indiana:** 2 hrs opioid
- **Illinois:** 150 hrs/3yr + multiple topics
- **Ohio:** 50 hrs/2yr Category 1

**Optimal Strategy:**
1. Track CME toward Illinois (highest: 150 hrs/3yr)
2. Include 2-hour opioid CME (satisfies Indiana)
3. Illinois hours easily exceed Ohio requirement
4. Indiana requires only minimal subset

---

## 8. Research Gaps & Limitations

### Critical Gaps

| Gap | Impact | Recommendation |
|-----|--------|-----------------|
| Renewal cycle timing | Compliance schedule | Contact IN-MLB |
| Opioid CME applicability | Who must complete | Review IC 25-22.5-6 |
| Opioid CME frequency | One-time vs. renewal | Contact IN-MLB |
| Verification mechanism | How checked | Contact IN-MLB |
| Renewal fees | Financial planning | Contact IN-MLB |
| Grace period | Deadline flexibility | Contact IN-MLB |

### Research Limitations

[CRITICAL] Limited web access. Based on:
- FSMB State CME Requirements database
- State-research-tracker.csv
- Inference from similar states

**Missing sources:**
- Direct statute access
- Board website
- Renewal application
- Administrative rules

### Cross-Source Validation

- FSMB: "No set CME hours" ✅ CONFIRMED
- FSMB: "2 hrs opioid prescribing/abuse starting July 1, 2019" ✅ CONFIRMED

---

## 9. Rules Engine Implementation

### Unique Challenge

Indiana's hybrid model creates unique requirements:

**Indiana System:**
```
IF (opioid_cme_2hrs_complete OR exempt) AND (physician_attests_competency)
  THEN renewal_eligible = TRUE
```

### Recommended Approach

**Minimum:**
- Track 2-hour opioid CME completion
- Track DEA status (determines applicability)
- Alert federal MATE Act if DEA registered
- Note: "Indiana - No total hours, 2-hr opioid only"

**Enhanced:**
- Voluntary total CME tracking for multi-state
- Hospital credentialing reports
- Board certification MOC integration
- Multi-state license optimization

## Conclusion

Indiana MD renewal represents a **unique hybrid model** (TIER 1) combining professional autonomy (no total hours) with targeted public health intervention (2-hour opioid CME).

**Core Requirements:**
- NO total CME hours (one of only 4 states)
- 2 hours opioid prescribing/abuse CME (effective July 1, 2019) - ONLY mandatory topic
- Federal MATE Act (8 hrs) if DEA registered

**Key Characteristics:**
- Most minimal CME burden among states addressing opioid crisis
- Hybrid balances autonomy with public health
- Simple compliance tracking

**Research Completeness: 68%** - Critical gaps remain. Direct board contact recommended.

**For Physicians:** Complete 2-hour opioid CME if applicable. Complete MATE Act if DEA registered. Consider voluntary CME tracking for hospitals and multi-state licenses.

**For Rules Engine:** Track 2-hour opioid completion plus competency attestation. Consider voluntary tracking for multi-state optimization.
