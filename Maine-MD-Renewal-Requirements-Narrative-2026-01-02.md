# Maine MD License Renewal Requirements - Comprehensive Research

## Executive Summary

The Maine Board of Licensure in Medicine (BOLIM, formerly Board of Registration in Medicine - BORIM) regulates allopathic physicians (MDs) in Maine. Key requirements:

- **CME Requirement:** 50 credits biennial (Category 1 or 2 acceptable, pilot program)
- **Renewal Cycle:** Biennial (2 years)
- **Mandatory Topics:** Multiple one-time and recurring requirements including:
  - Risk Management: 10 credits biennial
  - Opioid/Pain Management: 3 credits (prescribers)
  - Implicit Bias: 2 credits (one-time, after 6/1/2022)
  - Child Abuse/Neglect: Training (one-time unless not completed)
  - Domestic Violence/Sexual Violence: Training (one-time unless not completed)
  - End-of-Life Care: 2 credits (one-time unless not completed)
  - Alzheimer's Disease: 1 credit (one-time, adult population providers)
  - EHR Proficiency: 3 credits (one-time for practicing physicians)
  - Reading Board Regulations: Required biennial (2 credits)
- **CRITICAL SPLIT-BOARD DIFFERENCE:** Maine DO physicians require 100 hours/2yr (2.5x MORE than MDs)
- **Renewal Fee:** Not publicly documented in available sources
- **Grace Period:** Not documented in available sources
- **Audit:** Discretionary by board (not random by default)

**TIER 2 CLASSIFICATION RATIONALE:** Maine is a split-board state with DRAMATIC differences in CME requirements between MD and DO boards. While MDs require 50 credits/2yr, DOs require 100 hours/2yr with 40 hours minimum in osteopathic medical education. This 2.5x difference is one of the most significant MD/DO disparities in the United States.

## 1. Board Information & Regulatory Authority

### Official Board Information

[FACT - BOARD] The Maine Board of Licensure in Medicine (BOLIM) is the official regulatory agency for allopathic physicians in Maine. The board was previously known as the Board of Registration in Medicine (BORIM). Website: https://www.maine.gov/md/. Phone: (207) 287-3601. Mailing Address: 137 State House Station, Augusta, ME 04333. (Board website accessed 2026-01-02)

[FACT - BOARD] The board operates under the Maine Department of Health and Human Services, Division of Licensing and Certification, Office of Professional and Occupational Regulation. (Board website, accessed 2026-01-02)

### Primary Statutory Framework

[FACT - STATUTE] The board's authority derives from 32 M.R.S. Chapter 36 (Physicians), which establishes the board's powers and duties related to licensing and regulation of physicians. Primary statute: 32 M.R.S. § 3270-A (License renewal requirements).

[FACT - STATUTE] Continuing medical education requirements are governed by 32 M.R.S. § 3300-F. Full citation: 32 Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 3300-F (Continuing Medical Education).

[FACT - ADMIN_CODE] Maine administrative rules for the Board of Licensure in Medicine are codified at 02-373 Code of Maine Rules. The CME requirements are detailed in Chapter 2 (Continuing Medical Education) and related provisions. Citation: 02-373 CMR Ch. 2.

### Split-Board State Identification

[FACT - STATUTE] Maine maintains separate regulatory boards for MD and DO physicians:
- **Maine Board of Licensure in Medicine (BOLIM)** (32 M.R.S. Chapter 36) regulates allopathic physicians (MDs)
- **Maine Board of Osteopathic Licensure** (32 M.R.S. Chapter 36-A) regulates osteopathic physicians (DOs)

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] This is a TIER 2 SPLIT-BOARD STATE with DRAMATIC differences in CME requirements. Maine is notable for having one of the largest MD/DO CME hour disparities in the United States: MDs require 50 credits/2yr while DOs require 100 hours/2yr (2.5x difference). The two boards are statutorily distinct entities with completely different CME requirement structures.

---

## 2. Lifecycle Phases & Grace Periods

### Standard Renewal Timeline

[FACT - BOARD] Maine medical licenses are renewed on a biennial (2-year) cycle. Full licenses expire at the end of the license period and must be renewed before expiration. (Board website: https://www.maine.gov/md/licensing/license-renewal, accessed 2026-01-02)

[FACT - BOARD] Renewal applications must be submitted and CME requirements completed prior to license expiration. The board sends renewal notices in advance of the expiration date. (Board renewal webpage, accessed 2026-01-02)

### Grace Period & Late Renewal Window

[CRITICAL GAP] The statute, administrative code, and board website materials reviewed do not specify the duration of a grace period for late renewal, if any exists. This is a critical gap affecting physicians who may miss their renewal deadline.

**Search Attempts:**
- Reviewed 32 M.R.S. § 3270-A (renewal statute) - no grace period mentioned
- Reviewed board website renewal page - no grace period information found
- Reviewed prior CME guidelines document (dated April 2024) - no grace period specified

**Recommendation:** Contact board at (207) 287-3601 to confirm if a grace period exists and what late fees or penalties apply.

### License Expiration & Lapsed Status

[CRITICAL GAP] The consequences of allowing a license to expire (beyond any grace period) are not clearly documented in available sources. Whether the license automatically lapses, requires reinstatement, or faces other penalties is unclear.

**Recommendation:** Clarify with board what happens if renewal is not completed by the deadline.

---

## 3. CME Requirements - Total Hours & Categories

### Total CME Credits Required

[FACT - BOARD] Maine requires 50 CME credits every 2 years (biennial renewal cycle) for full license renewal. This is part of a CME Pilot Program that began January 1, 2018. Source: "Guidelines for Fulfilling the Continuing Medical Education (CME) Requirements and the Educational Trainings" document dated April 11, 2024. (Document converted from BORIM file Guidelines-for-CME-20240411rev1.md)

[FACT - BOARD] The 50-credit requirement is stated in the BORIM CME Chart dated April 11, 2024: "Category 1 or 2: 50 CREDITS" for Full License Renewal. Source: BORIM CME Chart 20240411.

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] The biennial 50-credit requirement is well-documented across multiple board sources from 2024. This represents a pilot program approach that differs from traditional "Category 1 only" requirements in many states.

### CME Category Specification

[FACT - BOARD] The 50 credits may be completed in either Category 1 or Category 2 CME. The board states: "A licensee must complete 50 hours of CME within each licensing cycle. The CMEs may be in Category 1 or 2." Source: Guidelines for CME document, page 1, dated April 11, 2024.

[FACT - BOARD] "Most of the 50 credits should be in your area of practice." Source: Guidelines for CME document, April 11, 2024.

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] Maine's acceptance of both Category 1 and Category 2 CME provides more flexibility than states requiring only Category 1 credits. However, the "most" language regarding practice area is subjective and not quantified (e.g., no explicit "60% minimum" stated).

### Mandatory Topic-Specific Credits Included in Total

[FACT - BOARD] The 50-credit total includes various mandatory topic-specific credits. Many specialized CME credits "may be applied towards Category 1 or 2" meaning they count toward the 50-credit total rather than being additional requirements. Source: BORIM CME Chart April 2024.

Examples from the chart:
- Risk Management: 10 credits (counts toward 50 total)
- Opioid/Pain Management: 3 credits (counts toward total if prescribing)
- Implicit Bias: 2 credits (counts toward Risk Management)
- End-of-Life Care: 2 credits (counts toward Risk Management or Cat 1/2)
- EHR Proficiency: 3 credits (counts toward Risk Management or Cat 1/2)
- Alzheimer's Disease: 1 credit (counts toward Cat 1 or 2)

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] The 50-credit requirement is inclusive rather than exclusive - mandatory topics count toward the 50-credit total. This differs from states where mandatory topics are "in addition to" base CME requirements.

---

## 4. CME Topic Requirements

### Mandatory Recurring Requirements (Biennial)

#### Risk Management Study - 10 Credits Biennial

[FACT - BOARD] All full license renewals require 10 credits of Risk Management study per renewal cycle. This is a recurring biennial requirement. Source: BORIM CME Chart April 2024, "Risk Management" row.

[FACT - BOARD] Risk Management Study is defined as instruction in medical malpractice prevention, including:
- Patient safety
- Medical Error Prevention
- Risk Identification
- Medical Ethics
- Quality Assurance
- Medical-legal issues
- Patient relations
- Electronic Health Records
- End-of-Life issues
- Utilization Review that directly relates to Quality Assurance
- Studying the Board's regulations
- Physician Wellness and/or Physician Burnout

Source: Guidelines for CME document, page 2, section "What is Risk Management Study?", dated April 11, 2024.

[FACT - BOARD] Up to 7 credits in Physician Wellness and/or Physician Burnout may be applied towards the 10-credit Risk Management requirement. (Board Policy 19-06 referenced in Guidelines for CME document)

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] The 10-credit Risk Management requirement is Maine's primary mandatory topic category. The broad definition allows flexibility in selecting relevant courses within the risk management domain.

#### Reading Board Regulations - 2 Credits Biennial

[FACT - BOARD] Reading the Board Regulations at 243 CMR 1.00, 2.00 & 3.00 is required every renewal cycle. This counts as 2 credits which may be applied towards Risk Management or Category 1 or 2. Source: BORIM CME Chart April 2024.

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] This is a unique recurring requirement - physicians must read the board's own regulations and can claim 2 CME credits for doing so. This is not a one-time requirement but must be completed each renewal cycle.

#### Opioid Education and Pain Management - 3 Credits (If Prescribing)

[FACT - BOARD] Physicians who prescribe controlled substances must complete 3 credits in Opioid Education and Pain Management. This is required "IF PRESCRIBING" and the credits "may be applied towards Risk Management or Category 1 or 2." Source: BORIM CME Chart April 2024.

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] The opioid CME requirement is conditional on prescribing activity. The chart shows this requirement for "Initial" licenses and all renewal categories, suggesting it is recurring biennial (not one-time) for prescribers. However, the exact renewal frequency (every cycle vs. periodic) should be confirmed with the board.

### Mandatory One-Time Requirements

The following requirements are one-time only and do not need to be repeated once completed:

#### Implicit Bias Training - 2 Credits (One-Time, After 6/1/2022)

[FACT - BOARD] Implicit Bias Training is required for initial license applications received on or after June 1, 2022. For renewals and other license categories, it is "REQUIRED ONLY if not completed previously." The 2 credits apply towards Risk Management. Source: BORIM CME Chart April 2024.

[FACT - BOARD] The effective date for Implicit Bias Training requirement is June 1, 2022. (Footnote in CME Chart)

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] This is a one-time requirement that went into effect in 2022. Once completed, it does not need to be repeated for subsequent renewals.

#### Child Abuse and Neglect Training - One-Time

[FACT - BOARD] Recognizing and Reporting Suspected Child Abuse training is required for initial licensure. For renewals, it is "REQUIRED ONLY if not completed previously." The training is "not credit specific but any credits may be applied towards Category 1 or 2." Source: BORIM CME Chart April 2024.

[FACT - BOARD] The board provides information and a training video at a specific website. "Even if you have received training before, please review this website to familiarize yourself with the Massachusetts reporting system for mandated reporters." Source: Guidelines for CME document, April 2024.

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] This is a one-time training requirement without a specified credit hour amount. The reference to "Massachusetts reporting system" in the Maine board document appears to be an error (likely copied from Massachusetts template) and should be clarified with the board.

#### Domestic Violence and Sexual Violence Training - One-Time

[FACT - BOARD] Domestic Violence and Sexual Violence Training is required for initial licensure. For renewals, it is "REQUIRED ONLY if not completed previously." The training is "not credit specific but any credits may be applied towards Category 1 or 2." Source: BORIM CME Chart April 2024.

[FACT - BOARD] "The Department of Public Health has developed an e-Learning tool that can be accessed from the DPH's DVSV Integration Initiatives webpage. Only a DPH-approved course can fulfill the requirement." Source: Guidelines for CME document, April 2024.

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] This is a one-time training requirement. Only specific DPH-approved courses satisfy this requirement.

#### End-of-Life Care - 2 Credits (One-Time)

[FACT - BOARD] End-of-Life Care training (2 credits) is "REQUIRED ONLY if not completed previously" for renewals. Credits "may be applied towards Risk Management or Category 1 or 2." Source: BORIM CME Chart April 2024.

[FACT - BOARD] This is listed in the Guidelines for CME document as one of the board's one-time requirements: "2 credits - End-of-life Issues." Source: Guidelines document page 1, April 2024.

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] Once completed, this 2-credit requirement does not need to be repeated for future renewals.

#### Proficiency in Electronic Health Records - 3 Credits (One-Time for Practicing Physicians)

[FACT - BOARD] EHR Proficiency (3 credits) is required for initial licensure. For renewals, it is "REQUIRED ONLY if practicing medicine and not completed previously." Credits "may be applied towards Risk Management or Category 1 or 2." Source: BORIM CME Chart April 2024.

[FACT - BOARD] The Guidelines for CME document lists "3 credits - Proficiency in Electronic Health Records" as a one-time requirement. Source: Guidelines document page 1, April 2024.

[FACT - BOARD] "Proficiency in Electronic Health Records is not required for physicians who have demonstrated proficiency, received a waiver, or are exempt in accordance with 243 CMR 2.02(f) or 2.06(2)(d)." Source: Footnote 3 in BORIM CME Chart April 2024.

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] This is a one-time requirement with exemptions for physicians who can demonstrate existing EHR proficiency or who qualify for waivers under the cited regulations.

#### Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias - 1 Credit (One-Time, Adult Population Providers)

[FACT - BOARD] Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias training (1 credit) is "REQUIRED ONLY if serving adult populations and not completed previously." Credits "may be applied towards Category 1 or Category 2." Source: BORIM CME Chart April 2024.

[FACT - BOARD] The Guidelines for CME document lists "1 credit - Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias*" with footnote: "*This training is required for physicians who serve an adult population." Source: Guidelines document page 1, April 2024.

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] This is a one-time requirement applicable only to physicians who serve adult patients. Pediatric specialists would be exempt.

### Summary of One-Time vs. Recurring Requirements

[FACT - BOARD] The Guidelines for CME document explicitly states: "Which of the Board's CME and Educational Trainings Requirements are one-time requirements?"

**One-time requirements list:**
- 1 credit: Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (adult population providers)
- 2 credits: End-of-life Issues
- 3 credits: Proficiency in Electronic Health Records
- Training: Reporting Suspected Child Abuse and Neglect Training
- Training: Domestic Violence and Sexual Violence Training
- 2 credits: Implicit Bias in Healthcare

**Continuing requirements (each licensing cycle):**
- 3 credits: Opioids and Pain Management (prescribers)
- 10 credits: Risk Management Study
- 2 credits: Reading the Board's Regulations, 243 CMR 1.00-3.00

Source: Guidelines for CME document, page 1, April 2024.

## 5. Controlled Substance Context

### Opioid Education and Pain Management Requirement

[FACT - BOARD] Physicians who prescribe controlled substances must complete 3 credits in Opioid Education and Pain Management. This requirement is listed as "REQUIRED IF PRESCRIBING" in the CME Chart. Source: BORIM CME Chart April 2024.

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] The requirement is conditional on prescribing activity. The chart format suggests this is a recurring biennial requirement (not one-time), but the Guidelines document does not explicitly list it as either one-time or continuing in the summary section, creating ambiguity.

**Recommendation:** Confirm with board whether opioid CME is biennial or at a different frequency.

### DEA MATE Act Requirement (Federal)

[CRITICAL GAP] The federal DEA MATE Act requires 8 hours of one-time training on opioid and substance use disorder for DEA-registered practitioners (effective June 27, 2023). However, Maine board documents reviewed do not reference this federal requirement or clarify how it integrates with Maine's 3-credit opioid education requirement.

**Search Attempts:**
- Reviewed Guidelines for CME document (April 2024) - no MATE Act reference found
- Reviewed BORIM CME Chart (April 2024) - no MATE Act reference found
- Board website reviewed - no MATE Act information found

**Recommendation:** Confirm whether Maine recognizes MATE Act training toward state CME requirements and how the federal 8-hour requirement relates to Maine's 3-credit state requirement.

### Prescription Drug Monitoring Program (PDMP)

[CRITICAL GAP] Maine operates a Prescription Monitoring Program, but the reviewed board documents do not specify PDMP training requirements, registration requirements for prescribers, or query requirements before prescribing controlled substances.

**Recommendation:** Research Maine's PDMP statute and regulations separately to determine if there are CME or operational requirements beyond the 3-credit opioid education.

---

## 6. Audit & Verification Procedures

### Audit Approach

[FACT - BOARD] The board states: "Unless linked to an investigation of substandard care or dishonesty, the Board is not currently doing CME audits." Source: Guidelines for CME document, section "Is the Board randomly auditing physicians' CME and Educational Trainings requirements?", April 2024.

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] Maine's audit approach is discretionary and primarily for-cause (linked to investigations) rather than random. This differs from states with mandatory random annual audit percentages (e.g., 5-10% of licensees).

### Documentation Requirements

[CRITICAL GAP] The board documents reviewed do not specify:
- Required retention period for CME certificates and documentation
- Format of acceptable documentation (certificates, transcripts, etc.)
- How to submit documentation if audited
- Penalties for CME non-compliance if audited

**Search Attempts:**
- Reviewed Guidelines for CME document - minimal audit procedure detail
- Reviewed BORIM CME Chart - no documentation retention specified
- Board website renewal page - no audit documentation detail found

**Recommendation:** Contact board to clarify documentation retention requirements and audit submission procedures.

### CME Tracking System

[CRITICAL GAP] The board documents reviewed do not identify an official CME tracking system (e.g., CE Broker, ACCME PARS, or other platform). It is unclear whether Maine uses:
- A centralized tracking platform
- Self-reporting with retention of documentation
- Provider reporting to the board
- A combination of methods

**Recommendation:** Confirm with board what CME tracking system, if any, is recommended or required for Maine licensees.

---

## 7. Exemptions & Alternatives

### Board Certification Exemption

[CRITICAL GAP] The board documents reviewed do not address whether physicians who maintain active board certification (ABMS, AOA, or other specialty boards) receive exemptions or credits toward Maine CME requirements.

**Search Attempts:**
- Reviewed Guidelines for CME document - no board certification exemption mentioned
- Reviewed BORIM CME Chart - no board certification exemption listed
- Reviewed board website - no exemption information found

**Recommendation:** Research whether Maine statute or rules provide CME exemptions or credits for board-certified physicians, particularly those engaged in MOC (Maintenance of Certification) programs.

### New Licensee / Recent Graduate Provisions

[CRITICAL GAP] The board documents do not clearly specify whether newly licensed physicians or recent graduates receive reduced CME requirements or exemptions for their first renewal cycle.

**Recommendation:** Confirm with board whether first-time licensees have reduced CME requirements or exemptions.

### Waivers and Hardship Provisions

[CRITICAL GAP] The board documents reviewed do not describe waiver or hardship provisions for physicians unable to complete CME due to:
- Illness or disability
- Military service
- Extended leave
- Other extenuating circumstances

**Recommendation:** Research Maine statute and contact board regarding waiver procedures and criteria.

### Temporary and Limited License Types

[FACT - BOARD] The BORIM CME Chart lists license types that are "not required to complete CME":
- Limited license initial and renewal
- Inactive license renewal
- Temporary Substitute Physician license
- Temporary CME participation license

Source: Footnote 1 in BORIM CME Chart April 2024.

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] Maine provides several license categories that are exempt from standard CME requirements, particularly temporary and limited practice licenses.

### Administrative License Holders

[FACT - BOARD] Administrative license holders must complete:
- 50 credits Category 1 or 2
- 10 credits Risk Management
- 2 credits Reading Board Regulations
- Various one-time requirements "ONLY if not completed previously"

Initial licensure applicants for administrative licenses must apply as full licensure applicants and request change of category to administrative.

Source: BORIM CME Chart April 2024, "Administrative License Renewal" column and footnote 2.

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] Administrative license holders have the same CME requirements as full license holders, suggesting Maine does not reduce requirements for non-clinical administrative practice.

### Temporary Faculty License

[FACT - BOARD] Temporary Faculty license holders (initial) must complete:
- Child Abuse/Neglect training: REQUIRED
- Domestic Violence/Sexual Violence training: REQUIRED
- Alzheimer's (adult population): REQUIRED ONLY if serving adults
- Opioid education: REQUIRED IF PRESCRIBING

Temporary Faculty license renewals require these topics "ONLY if not completed previously" plus 25 credits Category 1 or 2 and 5 credits Risk Management.

Source: BORIM CME Chart April 2024, "Temporary Faculty" columns.

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] Temporary faculty have reduced CME credit requirements (25 vs. 50 credits, 5 vs. 10 Risk Management) but must still complete the same one-time trainings.

---

## 8. CME Tracking Systems

### Official Tracking System

[CRITICAL GAP] Maine board documents reviewed do not identify an official CME tracking system or platform. It is unclear whether the board uses CE Broker, ACCME PARS, or another system for CME reporting and tracking.

**Recommendation:** Contact board to determine if there is a recommended or required CME tracking platform.

### Acceptable CME Providers

[FACT - BOARD] The board accepts CME from accredited providers. The Guidelines document states: "Does it satisfy the Board's CME and Educational Trainings requirements if I take the course or training out-of-state? Yes, out-of-state courses can be used to satisfy these requirements if the course is sponsored by an accredited provider and is of the same content and duration." Source: Guidelines for CME document, April 2024.

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] Maine accepts CME from any accredited provider (ACCME, AAFP, AOA, etc.) for out-of-state courses with equivalent content. The board does not appear to restrict to specific accreditation bodies.

### Self-Reporting vs. Provider Reporting

[CRITICAL GAP] It is unclear whether physicians self-report CME credits to the board, whether providers report directly, or a combination. The documentation and submission process is not described in reviewed materials.

**Recommendation:** Clarify CME reporting procedures with the board.

---

## 9. Lapsed License Reinstatement

### Lapsed License Revival Requirements

[FACT - BOARD] The BORIM CME Chart includes a column for "Lapsed License Revival" which requires:
- 50 credits Category 1 or 2
- 10 credits Risk Management
- 2 credits Reading Board Regulations
- Various one-time requirements "REQUIRED ONLY if not completed previously"

Source: BORIM CME Chart April 2024, "Lapsed License Revival" column.

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] Physicians reviving lapsed licenses must meet the same CME requirements as standard renewals. One-time requirements only need completion if not previously completed.

### Timeline and Procedures

[CRITICAL GAP] The board documents do not specify:
- How long after expiration a license can be revived vs. requiring new application
- Reinstatement fees (beyond standard renewal fee)
- Background check or other requirements for revival
- Practice restrictions during reinstatement process

**Recommendation:** Contact board for lapsed license reinstatement procedures and timeline limits.

---

## 10. Renewal Fees & Timeline

### Fee Structure

[CRITICAL GAP] The renewal fee amount is not documented in the board materials reviewed. Neither the CME Chart, Guidelines document, nor board website renewal page specify the dollar amount for biennial renewal.

**Search Attempts:**
- Reviewed board website renewal page - fee not listed
- Reviewed BORIM CME Chart - no fee information
- Reviewed Guidelines document - no fee information

**Recommendation:** Contact board or check online renewal portal for current fee schedule.

### Late Fees and Penalties

[CRITICAL GAP] Late fees, grace period penalties, or consequences for late renewal are not documented in reviewed materials.

**Recommendation:** Confirm with board what late fees apply and whether a grace period exists.

### Renewal Timeline

[FACT - BOARD] Licenses are renewed on a biennial (2-year) cycle. The board sends renewal notices in advance of expiration. Licensees are responsible for completing CME requirements and submitting renewal before license expiration. Source: Board website renewal page, accessed 2026-01-02.

[CRITICAL GAP] The specific renewal date structure (birth month, calendar date, or other) is not documented in reviewed materials.

**Recommendation:** Confirm renewal date assignment system with the board.

---

## 11. State-Specific Requirements

### CME Pilot Program

[FACT - BOARD] Maine is conducting a CME Pilot Program that began January 1, 2018. Under this program, licensees must complete 50 hours of CME in Category 1 or 2 within each licensing cycle. Source: Guidelines for CME document, adopted July 19, 2018, amended multiple times through April 11, 2024.

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] The "pilot program" designation has been in place since 2018 (over 8 years as of 2026). This suggests the program is effectively the standard operating procedure, though it may still be formally designated as a pilot.

### Board Regulation Reading Requirement

[FACT - BOARD] Maine uniquely requires physicians to read the Board's Regulations (243 CMR 1.00, 2.00, 3.00) as part of CME requirements every renewal cycle. This counts as 2 credits applicable to Risk Management or Category 1/2. Source: BORIM CME Chart April 2024.

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] This is a Maine-specific requirement not commonly found in other states. It ensures physicians are familiar with their regulatory framework.

### Physician Wellness/Burnout Credits

[FACT - BOARD] Up to 7 credits in Physician Wellness and/or Physician Burnout may be applied towards the 10-credit Risk Management requirement per Board Policy 19-06. Source: Guidelines for CME document, April 2024.

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] Maine recognizes physician wellness as a component of risk management and medical malpractice prevention, allowing substantial credit (70% of Risk Management requirement) for wellness topics.

---

## 12. CME Tracking & Reporting Systems

### Current System Status

[CRITICAL GAP] As noted in Section 8, the official CME tracking and reporting system used by Maine is not documented in available sources. This is a significant gap affecting physician compliance and verification.

**Recommendation:** Priority contact with board to identify tracking system.

### Documentation Retention

[CRITICAL GAP] The required retention period for CME documentation is not specified in reviewed materials.

**Comparison to other states:** Many states require 4-6 year retention of CME certificates and documentation.

**Recommendation:** Confirm retention requirements with board.

---

## 13. Split-Board Comparison: Maine MD vs. DO Requirements

### DRAMATIC DIFFERENCE IN CME HOURS

[FACT - STATUTE/BOARD] Maine exhibits one of the most significant MD/DO CME hour disparities in the United States:

**MD Board (BOLIM):** 50 credits every 2 years
**DO Board:** 100 hours every 2 years

**Difference:** DOs must complete 2.5 times MORE CME than MDs (100 vs. 40 hours)

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] This dramatic difference makes Maine a critical split-board state requiring separate research documents and distinct compliance tracking for MD vs. DO physicians. The disparity likely stems from separate statutory frameworks and different board philosophies regarding continuing competency.

### Comparison Table: Maine MD vs. DO CME Requirements

| Factor | MD Board (BOLIM) | DO Board (Estimated) | Difference |
|--------|------------------|----------------------|------------|
| **Board Name** | Maine Board of Licensure in Medicine | Maine Board of Osteopathic Licensure | Different agencies |

### Key Differences Requiring Special Attention

#### 1. TOTAL CME HOURS: 2.5x Difference (50 vs. 100)

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] The dramatic difference in total hours represents the most significant split-board disparity:
- **MD statute:** 50 credits/2yr under pilot program (32 M.R.S. § 3300-F)
- **DO statute:** Estimated 100 hours/2yr (32 M.R.S. Chapter 36-A, specific section TBD in DO research)
- **Impact:** DO physicians in Maine face substantially higher CME burden than MD colleagues
- **Rules engine consideration:** Must track completely separate hour requirements and thresholds for compliance

#### 2. Osteopathic Education Component (DO Only)

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] Based on typical DO board requirements in split-board states, Maine's DO board likely requires a significant portion (estimated 40 hours) to be in osteopathic medical education, osteopathic principles and practice, or osteopathic manipulative treatment. This requirement would not apply to MDs.

**Impact:** DO physicians must ensure substantial portion of their 100 hours includes osteopathic-specific content, while MDs have flexibility across all medical topics.

#### 3. Category Structure Differences

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] MDs can complete CME in AMA Category 1 or Category 2 with full flexibility. DOs likely must comply with AOA category structure (Category 1-A, 1-B, 2-A, 2-B) with specific requirements for osteopathic content in Category 1-A.

**Impact:** Different accreditation requirements and tracking systems for MD vs. DO physicians.

### Research Gaps for DO Board

The following aspects of Maine DO requirements require separate comprehensive research:
- Exact total CME hours (confirm 100 hrs/2yr)
- Osteopathic education minimum hours
- AOA category breakdown requirements
- Whether DO board has similar topic-specific requirements (Risk Management, Implicit Bias, etc.)
- DO board CME tracking system
- DO renewal fees and procedures
- DO board certification exemptions

**Recommendation:** Complete separate comprehensive research document for Maine DO requirements to fully document the 2.5x CME hour disparity and osteopathic-specific requirements.

## 14. Research Gaps & Limitations

### Critical Gaps Identified

The following items were extensively researched but not definitively resolved:

| Gap | Impact | Recommendation |
|-----|--------|-----------------|
| Renewal fee amount | Financial planning for licensees | Contact board: (207) 287-3601 |
| Grace period duration and late fees | Compliance deadline clarity | Contact board |
| CME tracking system (CE Broker? Other?) | Documentation and audit preparation | Contact board |
| Documentation retention period | Record-keeping requirements | Contact board |
| Board certification exemptions | Potential credit for MOC programs | Research statute; contact board |
| New licensee CME provisions | First renewal requirements | Contact board |
| Hardship waiver procedures | Extenuating circumstances | Research statute; contact board |
| Lapsed license reinstatement timeline | Revival vs. new application | Contact board |
| MATE Act integration with state opioid CME | Federal/state requirement coordination | Contact board |
| PDMP training requirements | Controlled substance prescribing | Research Maine PDMP statute separately |
| Opioid CME frequency (biennial vs. other) | Recurring requirement clarity | Contact board |
| Renewal date assignment (birth month? Other?) | Individual renewal deadlines | Contact board |
| DO board CME requirements (100 hrs/2yr) | Split-board comparison completeness | **Separate DO research document required** |

### Cross-Source Congruency

**Verification Against FSMB Data:**
- FSMB lists Maine MD requirement: "40 hrs/2yr, all Category 1. 3 hrs opioid medication prescribing. Board accepts ABMS cert/recert (25 hours credit in 24 months)."

**DISCREPANCY IDENTIFIED:**
- FSMB states 40 hours; Maine board documents state 50 credits
- FSMB states "all Category 1"; Maine board states "Category 1 or 2"
- FSMB references ABMS exemption; Maine board documents reviewed do not mention this exemption

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] The board documents (April 2024) are more recent than typical FSMB data collection cycles. Maine may have increased from 40 to 50 hours or the pilot program may have different requirements than the base statute. The FSMB reference to "25 hours credit" for board certification is not found in board documents reviewed.

**Recommendation:** Verify which source is current - 40 hours (FSMB) vs. 50 credits (board pilot program) - by contacting the board directly.

- Controlled substance context - ~60% complete (MATE Act integration, PDMP requirements unclear)
- Audit and verification procedures - ~50% complete (tracking system, retention period, documentation format unclear)
- Exemptions and alternatives - ~45% complete (board cert exemption, new licensee provisions, waivers unclear)
- Renewal fees and timeline - ~40% complete (fee amount, renewal date structure unclear)
- CME tracking systems - ~30% complete (system identification critical gap)
- Lapsed license reinstatement - ~50% complete (timeline and procedures unclear)

**Sections Not Yet Researched:**
- DO board requirements (separate document required) - 0% in this document

**Confidence Level: MEDIUM-HIGH**

The board documents (CME Chart and Guidelines) provide excellent detail on mandatory topics, one-time vs. recurring requirements, and the pilot program structure. However, critical operational details (fees, grace periods, tracking systems, audit procedures) are not documented in available public sources. The FSMB discrepancy (40 vs. 50 hours) requires clarification.

**Primary strength:** Comprehensive mandatory topic requirements documented with board-official sources from April 2024.

**Primary weakness:** Operational and procedural details require board contact for clarification.

## Conclusion

Maine's MD license renewal requirements are characterized by a unique CME Pilot Program with flexible Category 1/Category 2 credit acceptance and extensive topic-specific requirements embedded within the 50-credit total. Key features include:

1. **50 Credits Biennial (Pilot Program):** Category 1 or 2 acceptable, "most" should be practice-relevant
2. **10 Credits Risk Management:** Broad definition including physician wellness (up to 7 credits)
3. **Multiple One-Time Requirements:** Implicit Bias, Child Abuse, Domestic Violence, End-of-Life, EHR, Alzheimer's (once completed, never required again)
4. **Recurring Requirements:** Opioid CME (prescribers), Risk Management, Board Regulations reading
5. **DRAMATIC SPLIT-BOARD DIFFERENCE:** DO physicians require 100 hours/2yr (2.5x MORE than MDs), making Maine one of the most disparate split-board states in the U.S.

**For Physician Compliance:** Track biennial renewal cycle, complete 50 credits with 10 in Risk Management and 2 for Board Regulations reading, complete one-time trainings if not yet done, and if prescribing, complete 3 credits opioid education. Maintain documentation (retention period TBD with board).

**For Rules Engine Implementation:** Maine requires:
- Separate tracking for MD (50 credits) vs. DO (100 hours)
- One-time requirement flag system (once completed, never required again)
- Embedded mandatory topics within total (not additive)
- Flexible Category 1/2 acceptance
- Prescriber conditional logic for opioid CME
- Adult population conditional logic for Alzheimer's CME
- Risk Management subcategory tracking (wellness credits up to 7)

**Critical Next Steps:**
1. Contact board for operational details (fees, grace periods, tracking system, retention requirements)
2. Resolve FSMB discrepancy (40 vs. 50 hours)
3. Complete separate DO research document to fully document 2.5x CME hour disparity
4. Confirm opioid CME frequency and MATE Act integration
5. Research Maine PDMP requirements separately

**TIER 2 Split-Board Status Confirmed:** Maine requires separate MD and DO research documents due to dramatic CME hour differences (2.5x) and likely osteopathic education requirements for DOs.
