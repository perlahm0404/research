## 1. Board Information & Regulatory Authority

### Official Board Information

[FACT - BOARD] The Wisconsin Medical Examining Board is the official regulatory agency for physicians in Wisconsin, operating under the Wisconsin Department of Safety and Professional Services (DSPS). Website: https://dsps.wi.gov/. Phone: (608) 266-2112. (Accessed 2026-01-02)

[FACT - STATUTE] The Wisconsin Medical Examining Board's authority derives from the Wisconsin Medical Practices Law (Wis. Stat. § 448.01 et seq.) and the Wisconsin Department of Safety and Professional Services regulatory framework.

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] Wisconsin operates a unified medical board regulating both MD and DO physicians under the same statutory framework and CME requirements.

### Primary Statutory Framework

[FACT - STATUTE] Wisconsin Statutes § 448.40 establishes the statutory requirement for continuing education for license renewal. Source: Wis. Stat. § 448.40.

[FACT - ADMIN_CODE] Wisconsin Administrative Code Med 13 provides the detailed regulatory framework for continuing education requirements, including the 30-hour biennial requirement, category requirements, and mandatory topics. Source: Wis. Admin. Code Med 13.

[FACT - BOARD] Renewal portal: https://online.drl.wi.gov/ (Wisconsin Department of Regulation and Licensing online portal)

---

## 2. Renewal Cycle & Dates

### Biennial Renewal Schedule (Every 2 Years)

[FACT - STATUTE] Wisconsin physicians renew their medical licenses every 2 years (biennial cycle). Wis. Admin. Code Med 13.

[CRITICAL GAP] The specific renewal deadline dates (birth month, fixed date, license issuance anniversary, etc.) are not documented in the accessible materials reviewed. Physicians should verify their individual renewal date through the Wisconsin DSPS portal or by contacting the board directly.

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] Based on common state practices, Wisconsin likely uses either a birth month renewal system or a license issuance anniversary system. Individual physicians should confirm their renewal date.

### Renewal Timeline & Submission Windows

[CRITICAL GAP] Renewal submission window timeline (e.g., 60 days prior to expiration, 90 days prior) is not documented in accessible materials. Contact Wisconsin Medical Examining Board at (608) 266-2112 for specific renewal window information.

[CRITICAL GAP] Grace period mechanics and late renewal procedures are not documented in accessible statute or administrative code materials reviewed.

---

## 3. CME Requirements - Base Hours & Categories

### Total CME Hours Required (LOWEST Among Surveyed States)

[FACT - STATUTE] Wisconsin requires **30 continuing medical education hours every 2 years (biennial renewal cycle)**. All 30 hours must be AMA Category 1 or AOA equivalent. Wis. Admin. Code Med 13.03.

[FACT - FSMB] FSMB State CME Requirements document confirms: "30 hrs/2yr, all Category 1. 2 hrs opioid/controlled substance prescribing. DEA-only requirement: 8 hrs opioid use disorder (separate from state requirement)." This matches the statutory requirement.

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] Wisconsin has the **lowest total CME hour requirement (30 hours biennial)** among the states surveyed in this research project. For comparison:
- Nebraska: 50 hours biennial
- Utah: 40 hours biennial
- Virginia: 60 hours biennial
- Wyoming: 60 hours triennial (20 hours/year average)
- Wisconsin: **30 hours biennial** (LOWEST)

### Category Requirements (All Category 1)

[FACT - STATUTE] All 30 hours must be **AMA Category 1 or AOA Category 1-A equivalent** (formal, accredited CME). Wisconsin does not accept AMA Category 2 or other informal CME for the base requirement. Wis. Admin. Code Med 13.03.

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] The Category 1-only requirement means physicians must complete formal, accredited CME activities. Self-study, journal reading, or other informal activities (typically Category 2) do not count toward the 30-hour requirement.

[FACT - FSMB] FSMB confirms: "30 hrs/2yr, all Category 1."

---

## 4. CME Topic Requirements - Mandatory Topics

### Overview of Mandatory Topics (State + Federal Requirements)

[FACT - STATUTE] Wisconsin has a dual mandatory topic structure:
1. **State Requirement:** 2 hours opioid/controlled substance prescribing biennial (all physicians)
2. **Federal DEA Requirement:** 8 hours opioid use disorder training (one-time for DEA registrants, effective June 27, 2023)

Wis. Admin. Code Med 13 and Federal MATE Act.

[FACT - FSMB] FSMB confirms: "2 hrs opioid/controlled substance prescribing. DEA-only requirement: 8 hrs opioid use disorder (separate from state requirement)."

[CRITICAL - IMPORTANT DISTINCTION] The state 2-hour requirement and federal 8-hour DEA requirement are **separate and distinct**. DEA registrants must complete **both** requirements:
- 2 hours opioid/controlled substance prescribing (Wisconsin state requirement, biennial, all physicians)
- 8 hours opioid use disorder training (federal MATE Act requirement, one-time, DEA registrants only)

### Topic 1: Opioid/Controlled Substance Prescribing (2 hours biennial, MANDATORY - All Physicians)

[FACT - STATUTE] All Wisconsin physicians must complete **2 hours of continuing education on opioid/controlled substance prescribing** every 2 years (biennial). This is a Wisconsin state requirement. Wis. Admin. Code Med 13.

[FACT - FSMB] FSMB confirms: "2 hrs opioid/controlled substance prescribing."

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] The 2-hour opioid/controlled substance prescribing requirement is integrated into the 30-hour biennial total (not in addition to the 30 hours). Physicians complete 2 hours of opioid CME plus 28 hours of other Category 1 CME to reach the 30-hour total.

**Opioid/Controlled Substance CME Content Areas (Likely):**
- Safe opioid prescribing practices
- Controlled substance risk assessment and screening
- Wisconsin Prescription Drug Monitoring Program (PDMP) use and interpretation
- Recognition of opioid use disorder and addiction
- Alternative pain management strategies
- CDC opioid prescribing guidelines
- Benzodiazepine prescribing and risks
- Other controlled substance prescribing (stimulants, barbiturates, etc.)

[CRITICAL GAP] Specific acceptable courses, providers, or content standards for the 2-hour opioid/controlled substance requirement are not detailed in accessible materials. Physicians should verify acceptable courses with Wisconsin Medical Examining Board or review ACCME-accredited opioid CME offerings.

### Topic 2: Federal DEA Requirement - Opioid Use Disorder Training (8 hours one-time, CONDITIONAL - DEA Registrants Only)

[FACT - FEDERAL] The federal Medication Access and Training Expansion (MATE) Act, effective **June 27, 2023**, requires physicians with DEA registration to complete **8 hours of training on opioid use disorder** as a **one-time requirement**. This is a federal DEA requirement, not a Wisconsin state requirement.

[FACT - FSMB] FSMB confirms: "DEA-only requirement: 8 hrs opioid use disorder (separate from state requirement)."

[CRITICAL - IMPORTANT DISTINCTION] The federal 8-hour MATE Act requirement is **separate from and in addition to** the Wisconsin state 2-hour opioid/controlled substance prescribing requirement. DEA registrants must complete **both**:
- Wisconsin state: 2 hours opioid/controlled substance prescribing (biennial, ongoing)
- Federal DEA: 8 hours opioid use disorder training (one-time, completed by June 27, 2026 for existing DEA registrants)

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] The federal MATE Act requirement applies to physicians who:
- Hold DEA registration (Schedule II-V prescribing authority)
- Were registered before June 27, 2023 (must complete by June 27, 2026 - 3-year grace period)
- Register after June 27, 2023 (must complete before initial DEA registration)

**Federal MATE Act CME Content Areas (Required):**
- Treating and managing patients with opioid or other substance use disorders
- Safe pharmacological treatment of opioid use disorder (including buprenorphine, methadone, naltrexone)
- Safe prescribing practices for controlled substances
- Identification of patients at risk for substance use disorders
- Overdose prevention and reversal (naloxone distribution and training)
- Counseling and referral resources for substance use disorders

[CRITICAL GAP] Whether the federal 8-hour MATE Act requirement counts toward the Wisconsin 30-hour biennial requirement or is in addition to it is not explicitly documented.

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] Based on common state practices and the FSMB notation of "separate from state requirement," the federal 8-hour MATE Act requirement likely counts toward the Wisconsin 30-hour biennial requirement (as 8 hours of Category 1 CME), but this should be verified with the Wisconsin Medical Examining Board.

### Dual Requirement Compliance Example (DEA Registrant)

**Scenario: Wisconsin physician with DEA registration, renewing in 2026**

**State Requirement (Biennial):**
- 30 hours Category 1 CME biennial
- 2 hours must focus on opioid/controlled substance prescribing

**Federal Requirement (One-Time):**
- 8 hours opioid use disorder training (MATE Act)
- Must be completed by June 27, 2026 (if DEA registered before June 27, 2023)

**Total Compliance (Assuming Federal Hours Count Toward State Requirement):**
- Complete 8 hours federal MATE Act training (counts as 8 hours Category 1)
- Complete 2 hours opioid/controlled substance prescribing (Wisconsin state requirement)
- Complete 20 hours other Category 1 CME
- **Total: 30 hours Category 1 CME biennial**

[CRITICAL GAP] Whether the 2-hour state requirement can be satisfied by the 8-hour federal requirement (i.e., the 8 hours encompasses the 2 hours) or must be completed separately is not documented. Physicians should contact Wisconsin Medical Examining Board for clarification.

---

## 5. Exemptions & Alternatives

### DEA Exemption (Non-Registrants)

[FACT - FEDERAL] The federal 8-hour MATE Act requirement applies only to physicians with DEA registration. Physicians who do not hold DEA registration are exempt from this federal requirement.

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] Non-DEA-registered physicians complete only the Wisconsin state requirements:
- 30 hours Category 1 CME biennial
- 2 hours opioid/controlled substance prescribing biennial

### Board Certification (ABMS/AOA)

[CRITICAL GAP] Whether ABMS board certification or ABMS Maintenance of Certification (MOC) provides any exemption or credit toward the Wisconsin CME requirement is not documented in accessible materials.

[INFERENCE - LOW CONFIDENCE] Unlike some states (e.g., Texas, Idaho) that provide explicit CME exemptions for board-certified physicians, Wisconsin does not appear to offer a board certification exemption in the accessible statute and administrative code. However, board certification activities (MOC) may count toward the 30-hour Category 1 requirement if they are ACCME-accredited.

### Newly Licensed Physicians

[CRITICAL GAP] Whether newly licensed physicians (first-time renewals) receive any exemption, reduction, or pro-rated CME requirement is not documented in accessible materials.

### Military Service & Hardship Exemptions

[CRITICAL GAP] Military service exemptions, hardship exemptions, or other special circumstances (illness, disability, etc.) are not documented in accessible materials.

---

## 6. Audit & Verification Procedures

### CME Documentation Requirements

[FACT - STATUTE] Physicians must maintain documentation of CME completion for audit and verification purposes. Wis. Admin. Code Med 13.

[CRITICAL GAP] The specific documentation retention period (e.g., 4 years, 6 years, duration of licensure) is not documented in accessible materials.

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] Physicians should retain CME certificates, transcripts, or other proof of completion for at least the duration of the current renewal cycle plus one additional cycle (approximately 4 years) to ensure availability in case of audit.

### Audit Procedures

[FACT - STATUTE] The Wisconsin Medical Examining Board conducts random audits of physicians for CME compliance. Wis. Admin. Code Med 13.

[CRITICAL GAP] The percentage or frequency of audits (e.g., 5% of renewals annually, 10% of renewals) is not published in statute or accessible materials.

[CRITICAL GAP] Audit response timeline (e.g., 30 days to provide documentation, 60 days) is not documented.

[CRITICAL GAP] Consequences of audit non-compliance (fines, license suspension, additional CME requirements) are not detailed in accessible materials.

---

## 7. Renewal Procedures & Fees

### Standard Renewal Process

[FACT - BOARD] Physicians renew through the Wisconsin Department of Regulation and Licensing online portal at: https://online.drl.wi.gov/

[CRITICAL GAP] Renewal submission window (when renewal opens prior to expiration) is not documented in accessible materials.

### Renewal Fees

[CRITICAL GAP] The specific renewal fee amount is not published in accessible materials reviewed. Physicians should check the renewal portal or contact Wisconsin Medical Examining Board at (608) 266-2112 for current fee information.

### Grace Period & Late Renewal

[CRITICAL GAP] Grace period mechanics (if any), late renewal procedures, and late fees are not documented in statute or accessible materials.

---

## 8. Lapsed License Reinstatement

### Reinstatement Procedures

[CRITICAL GAP] Lapsed license reinstatement procedures, timelines, and CME requirements for reinstatement are not documented in the materials reviewed.

[INFERENCE - LOW CONFIDENCE] Wisconsin likely has tiered reinstatement procedures based on length of lapse (e.g., <1 year, 1-3 years, >3 years), similar to other TIER 1 states, but specific requirements are not documented.

---

## 9. Controlled Substance Context

### State Opioid/Controlled Substance CME (2 hours biennial)

[FACT - STATUTE] As detailed in Section 4, all physicians must complete 2 hours of opioid/controlled substance prescribing education biennial. This is a Wisconsin state requirement. Wis. Admin. Code Med 13.

### Federal DEA MATE Act Requirement (8 hours one-time, DEA registrants)

[FACT - FEDERAL] As detailed in Section 4, physicians with DEA registration must complete 8 hours of opioid use disorder training as a one-time requirement under the federal MATE Act, effective June 27, 2023.

### Wisconsin Prescription Drug Monitoring Program (PDMP)

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] The 2-hour state opioid/controlled substance requirement likely includes training on the Wisconsin Prescription Drug Monitoring Program (PDMP).

[CRITICAL GAP] Whether the 2-hour requirement includes a specific component on PDMP use (similar to Nebraska's 0.5-hour PDMP requirement) is not documented.

---

## 10. CME Tracking Systems

### CME Tracking & Documentation

[CRITICAL GAP] Whether Wisconsin uses a centralized CME tracking system (e.g., CE Broker) or relies on physician attestation and audit is not documented in accessible materials.

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] Based on common TIER 1 state practices, Wisconsin likely uses a physician attestation system where physicians certify CME completion during renewal, with documentation verified only upon audit.

### CME Provider Auto-Reporting

[CRITICAL GAP] Whether CME providers are required to auto-report completion to the Wisconsin Medical Examining Board is not documented.

---

### Cross-Source Congruency

**Verification Against FSMB Data:**
- FSMB reports: "30 hrs/2yr, all Category 1" ✅ **MATCHES statute** (Wis. Admin. Code Med 13)
- FSMB reports: "2 hrs opioid/controlled substance prescribing" ✅ **MATCHES statute**
- FSMB reports: "DEA-only requirement: 8 hrs opioid use disorder (separate from state requirement)" ✅ **MATCHES federal MATE Act**

**Congruency Assessment:** FSMB data aligns with Wisconsin statute and federal law. No significant conflicts identified. The FSMB notation of "separate from state requirement" for the federal DEA requirement is important for understanding the dual structure.

**Confidence Level: HIGH for core 30-hour requirement and dual opioid structure (state 2 hrs + federal 8 hrs), MEDIUM for integration mechanics between state and federal requirements, LOW for procedural details and exemptions**

The core CME structure is clearly articulated in statute and administrative code, including the important dual requirement structure (state 2-hour opioid + federal 8-hour DEA MATE Act). The main challenges are:
1. **Limited published information on procedural details** (renewal dates, fees, grace periods)
2. **Unclear integration of federal 8-hour MATE Act requirement with state 30-hour total**
3. **Unclear overlap between state 2-hour and federal 8-hour opioid requirements**
4. **Board certification exemption not found** in accessible materials

## Conclusion

Wisconsin MD license renewal requirements are **straightforward and simple** (TIER 1) with the **lowest total CME hour requirement (30 hours biennial)** among surveyed states, but include a **dual opioid training structure** (state 2-hour biennial + federal 8-hour one-time for DEA registrants).

**Core Requirements Summary:**
- 30 hours biennial CME, all AMA Category 1 or AOA equivalent (LOWEST among surveyed states)
- State mandatory: 2 hours opioid/controlled substance prescribing biennial (all physicians)
- Federal DEA mandatory: 8 hours opioid use disorder training one-time (DEA registrants only, effective June 27, 2023)
- Biennial renewal cycle (specific dates not documented)
- Random audits conducted

**Key Simplicity Factors:**
1. Lowest total CME hour requirement (30 hours biennial) provides compliance ease
2. All Category 1 (clear, no mixed category complexity)
3. Single state mandatory topic (2 hours opioid/controlled substance)
4. Federal DEA requirement is one-time (not recurring)
5. No complex multi-cycle or state-specific requirements

**Key Complexity Factor:**
1. **Dual opioid training structure** (state 2-hour biennial + federal 8-hour one-time) requires careful tracking for DEA registrants

**For Physician Compliance:**
- **All physicians:** Complete 30 hours of AMA Category 1 CME every 2 years, ensuring 2 hours focus on opioid/controlled substance prescribing.
- **DEA registrants:** Additionally complete 8 hours of federal MATE Act opioid use disorder training (one-time, must be completed by June 27, 2026 if registered before June 27, 2023).
- **Non-DEA physicians:** Complete only the state requirement (30 hours including 2 hours opioid/controlled substance).

**For Rules Engine Implementation:** The primary implementation challenges are clarifying whether the federal 8-hour MATE Act requirement counts toward the state 30-hour total or is in addition to it, and whether the federal 8 hours can satisfy the state 2-hour requirement. Renewal date mechanics and fee information need to be obtained from the board for complete implementation. The dual requirement structure requires tracking of both state biennial and federal one-time requirements for DEA registrants.
