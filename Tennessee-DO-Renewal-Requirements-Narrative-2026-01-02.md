## 1. Board Information & Regulatory Authority

### Official Board Information

[FACT - BOARD] The Tennessee Board of Osteopathic Examination is the official regulatory agency for osteopathic physicians (DOs) in Tennessee. Website: https://www.tn.gov/health/health-program-areas/health-professional-boards/osteo-board.html. Phone: (615) 532-3202 or 1-800-778-4123. Email: Medical.Health@tn.gov. Address: 710 James Robertson Parkway, Nashville, TN 37243. (Accessed 2026-01-02)

[FACT - STATUTE] The board's authority derives from Tennessee Code Annotated § 63-9, the Tennessee Osteopathic Medical Practice Act. T.C.A. § 63-9-101 establishes the board's composition and powers. T.C.A. § 63-9-114 defines the practice of osteopathic medicine.

### Primary Statutory Framework

[FACT - STATUTE] Tennessee Code Annotated § 63-9-107 is the primary statute governing continuing medical education requirements for osteopathic physicians and license renewal. Full citation: T.C.A. § 63-9-107 (Renewal of certificates and licenses, continuing education, retirement). Source: https://law.justia.com/codes/tennessee/

[FACT - ADMIN_CODE] Tennessee Comprehensive Rules and Regulations 1050-02 provides detailed implementation requirements for osteopathic physician licensing and CME compliance. Key sections:
- 1050-02-.07 (Licensure Renewal and Reinstatement)
- 1050-02-.12 (Continuing Education Requirements)

Source: https://publications.tnsosfiles.com/rules_all/2018/1050-02.20251218.pdf (December 2025 revision)

### Split-Board State Identification

[FACT - STATUTE] Tennessee maintains separate regulatory boards for MD and DO physicians:
- **Tennessee Board of Medical Examiners** (T.C.A. § 63-6-201 et seq.) regulates allopathic physicians (MDs)
- **Tennessee Board of Osteopathic Examination** (T.C.A. § 63-9-101 et seq.) regulates osteopathic physicians (DOs)

[FACT - STATUTE] The two boards are statutorily distinct entities with separate CME category requirements and different renewal fees.

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] This is a SPLIT-BOARD STATE. Tennessee maintains separate websites, renewal portals, and regulatory frameworks for MD and DO licensees. While many requirements are identical (40 CME hours, 2-hour controlled substance CME), the CME category system differs significantly (AMA Category 1 for MDs vs. AOA Category mix for DOs).

---

## 2. Lifecycle Phases & Grace Periods

### Standard Renewal Timeline

[FACT - STATUTE] Tennessee osteopathic physician licenses are renewed on a biennial (2-year) cycle. Licenses expire in the licensee's birth month, creating varied renewal dates across the DO population. T.C.A. § 63-9-107(a).

[FACT - BOARD] Renewal notices are sent approximately 60 days prior to license expiration. Licensees are responsible for submitting renewal applications and fees by the expiration date. (https://www.tn.gov/health/health-program-areas/health-professional-boards/osteo-board.html, accessed 2026-01-02)

[FACT - STATUTE] Renewal cycle is 24 months (every 2 years), expiring in the licensee's birth month. T.C.A. § 63-9-107(a).

### Grace Period & Automatic Revocation

[FACT - STATUTE] Osteopathic physicians may renew within a 60-day grace period after license expiration. If renewal is not completed within 60 days of expiration, the license is **automatically revoked** without further notice or hearing. T.C.A. § 63-9-107(a).

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] The 60-day grace period is identical to the MD board grace period, but the consequence of missing the deadline (automatic revocation without hearing) is severe.

### License Expiration & Revocation

[FACT - STATUTE] Upon automatic revocation (more than 60 days after expiration), the license is permanently revoked. The osteopathic physician cannot practice medicine in Tennessee with a revoked license unless reinstatement procedures are followed. T.C.A. § 63-9-107(a).

---

## 3. CME Requirements - Total Hours & Categories

### Total CME Hours Required

[FACT - STATUTE] Tennessee requires 40 credit hours of continuing medical education every 2 years (biennial renewal cycle) for osteopathic physicians. T.C.A. § 63-9-107(a).

[FACT - ADMIN_CODE] All 40 hours must be from approved accredited providers. Tenn. Comp. R. & Regs. 1050-02-.12.

### CME Category Specification - AOA Categories

[FACT - STATUTE] Tennessee requires CME from American Osteopathic Association (AOA) categories. The category mix requirement is:
- **Category I-A:** Unlimited hours (highly recommended)
- **Category II-A:** Unlimited hours (highly recommended)
- **Category I-B:** Maximum of 20 hours (no more than 20 credits in this category)

T.C.A. § 63-9-107(a); Tenn. Comp. R. & Regs. 1050-02-.12

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] This is substantially different from the MD board requirement, which specifies AMA PRA Category 1 only. DO board allows for AOA category flexibility with a cap on Category I-B.

### Approved CME Providers

[FACT - STATUTE] Tennessee Board of Osteopathic Examination accepts CME credits from providers accredited by:
- **AOA** (American Osteopathic Association)
- **ACCME** (Accreditation Council for Continuing Medical Education)
- **AAFP** (American Academy of Family Physicians)

T.C.A. § 63-9-107(a); Tenn. Comp. R. & Regs. 1050-02-.12

[FACT - BOARD] The board accepts courses from any ACCME-accredited provider, not just AOA-accredited providers. This provides flexibility in CME source selection. (https://www.tn.gov/health/health-program-areas/health-professional-boards/osteo-board.html, accessed 2026-01-02)

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] Tennessee's approach to DO CME is more flexible than some states, accepting accreditation from multiple bodies (AOA, ACCME, AAFP).

### Flexibility in CME Timing

[FACT - BOARD] Osteopathic physicians may complete CME at any pace during the 2-year renewal cycle, as long as 40 total hours are completed by the renewal deadline. (https://www.tn.gov/health/health-program-areas/health-professional-boards/osteo-board.html, accessed 2026-01-02)

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] This allows flexibility in CME scheduling throughout the 2-year period, similar to the MD board approach.

---

## 4. CME Topic Requirements

### Mandatory Controlled Substance Prescribing CME

[FACT - STATUTE] All osteopathic physicians must complete a minimum of 2 hours of CME related to controlled substance prescribing as part of their required CME. This 2-hour requirement is part of the 40-hour total (not in addition to). T.C.A. § 63-9-107(a).

[FACT - STATUTE] The 2-hour controlled substance CME must include instruction in Tennessee Department of Health treatment guidelines on:
- Opioids
- Benzodiazepines
- Barbiturates
- Carisoprodol
- Addiction medicine (optional but approved)
- Risk management tools (optional but approved)

T.C.A. § 63-9-107(a)

[FACT - STATUTE] This controlled substance CME requirement is mandatory for all osteopathic physicians, regardless of DEA registration status. Even physicians without DEA registration must complete 2 hours in a course "designated specifically to address prescribing practices." T.C.A. § 63-9-107(a).

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] Unlike the MD board, which applies opioid CME only to certain physicians (DEA registrants for the 3-hour requirement), the DO board mandates 2-hour controlled substance CME for ALL DOs regardless of prescribing status.

### Other Mandatory CME Topics

[CRITICAL GAP] The statute and administrative code do not specify other mandatory CME topics beyond the 2-hour controlled substance prescribing requirement. No requirements found for cultural competency, physician wellness, or other common mandatory topics. Tennessee appears to have minimal topic-specific mandates beyond controlled substance CME for both MD and DO boards.

### New Graduate Exemption

[FACT - BOARD] Licensees obtaining osteopathic licensure in the same calendar year as passing NBOME, COMLEX, or USMLE Step 3 are exempted from CME requirements for that year only. (https://www.tn.gov/health/health-program-areas/health-professional-boards/osteo-board.html, accessed 2026-01-02)

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] This exemption provides relief for newly licensed osteopathic physicians in their first year of practice.

---

## 5. Controlled Substance Context

### Controlled Substance Education Requirement

[FACT - STATUTE] Tennessee Code Annotated § 63-1-402 requires all healthcare providers (including DOs) holding or applying for controlled substance prescribing authority to maintain controlled substance education credentials. T.C.A. § 63-1-402.

[FACT - STATUTE] The 2-hour controlled substance prescribing CME requirement for DOs addresses Tennessee Department of Health treatment guidelines on opioids, benzodiazepines, barbiturates, carisoprodol, and addiction medicine.

### DEA Registration Context

[FACT - STATUTE] The 2-hour controlled substance CME requirement applies to:
1. **DOs with DEA registration:** Must complete 2 hours on controlled substance prescribing (opioids, benzodiazepines, barbiturates, carisoprodol, addiction medicine)
2. **DOs without DEA registration:** Must still complete 2 hours but in courses "designated specifically to address prescribing practices" (general prescribing education, not just controlled substances)

T.C.A. § 63-9-107(a)

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] This approach requires all DOs to maintain awareness of prescribing practices even if they don't currently prescribe controlled substances.

### PDMP (Prescription Drug Monitoring Program)

[CRITICAL GAP] The statute and administrative code do not mandate specific PDMP training hours or CME. PDMP training is referenced as an approved topic but is not explicitly required.

### E-Prescribing Waiver Program

[FACT - BOARD] The Tennessee Board of Osteopathic Examination offers a waiver program for practitioners unable to comply with electronic prescription requirements for controlled substances. Waivers are based on:
- Economic hardship
- Technological limitations
- Exceptional circumstances

Waivers are free to apply for and processed via online form with email verification. (https://www.tn.gov/health/health-program-areas/health-professional-boards/osteo-board.html, accessed 2026-01-02)

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] This program addresses practical barriers to e-prescribing compliance while maintaining overall controlled substance oversight.

---

## 6. Audit & Verification Procedures

### Audit Selection

[FACT - STATUTE] Audits are conducted at the discretion of the Tennessee Department of Health to determine and confirm CME compliance. T.C.A. § 63-9-107(a).

[CRITICAL GAP] The statute does not specify an audit percentage or selection criteria (e.g., random selection, percentage of renewals audited). Audit selection appears to be fully discretionary with the board.

### Audit Notification

[FACT - BOARD] When selected for audit, the board mails a **certified letter** to the licensee notifying them of the audit selection and requesting CME documentation. (https://www.tn.gov/health/health-program-areas/health-professional-boards/osteo-board.html, accessed 2026-01-02)

[FACT - STATUTE] Continuing education documentation is only required when an official audit notice is received. At that point, licensees must submit proof of CME completion. T.C.A. § 63-9-107(a).

### CE Broker Automatic Audit Pass

[FACT - BOARD] If a licensee is selected for audit and is **current in CE Broker**, they **automatically pass the audit**. No additional documentation submission is required. (https://www.tn.gov/health/health-program-areas/health-professional-boards/osteo-board.html, accessed 2026-01-02)

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] This creates a powerful incentive to use CE Broker for CME tracking, as it guarantees audit passage.

### Acceptable Audit Documentation

[FACT - STATUTE] Acceptable documentation of CME compliance includes:
- CME certificates
- Official letters from CME providers
- Transcripts showing course completion
- AAFP documentation
- Any evidence of course completion with dates and hours

T.C.A. § 63-9-107(a)

### Document Retention

[FACT - STATUTE] All licensees must retain independent documentation of CME completion for **4 years**. Documentation must be available for board inspection if audited. T.C.A. § 63-9-107(a).

---

## 7. Exemptions & Alternatives

### Board Certification Exemption (Partial)

[FACT - STATUTE] Osteopathic physicians board-certified by any of the following organizations in specific specialties are EXEMPT from the 2-hour controlled substance prescribing CME requirement:

**Certifying Bodies:** ABMS (American Board of Medical Specialties), AOA (American Osteopathic Association), or ABPS (American Board of Physician Specialties)

**Exempt Specialties:**
- Pain Management
- Anesthesiology
- Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation
- Neurology
- Rheumatology

T.C.A. § 63-9-107(a)

[FACT - STATUTE] This exemption applies ONLY to the 2-hour controlled substance prescribing CME. These physicians must still complete 38 additional hours to meet the total 40-hour biennial requirement. T.C.A. § 63-9-107(a).

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] This is identical to the MD board exemption policy, providing consistent treatment across both boards for these specialties.

### Waivers and Modifications

[FACT - STATUTE] The Tennessee Board of Osteopathic Examination may waive CME requirements in cases of:
- Illness
- Disability
- Other undue hardship beyond the control of the licensee

T.C.A. § 63-9-107(a)

[FACT - STATUTE] Waiver requests must be submitted **before the renewal deadline**. Requests submitted after renewal deadline may not be considered. T.C.A. § 63-9-107(a).

[CRITICAL GAP] The statute does not specify what constitutes "undue hardship" or provide detailed waiver criteria. The board's standard for granting waivers should be clarified.

### Retirement Status Option

[FACT - STATUTE] Osteopathic physicians may request retirement status. Retirement status provides exemption from CME requirements. T.C.A. § 63-9-107(d).

[CRITICAL GAP] The statute does not specify how to request retirement status or whether separate licensing requirements apply. Retirement procedures should be clarified with the board.

---

## 8. CME Tracking Systems

### Official Tracking System - CE Broker

[FACT - BOARD] Tennessee Board of Osteopathic Examination provides free Basic Accounts in CE Broker to all licensees. CE Broker is the official CME tracking system for Tennessee DOs. (https://cebroker.com/tn/, accessed 2026-01-02)

**CE Broker Features for Tennessee DOs:**

- Customer support: 877-434-6323 (8 AM-8 PM ET, Monday-Friday)

### Documentation Requirements

[FACT - STATUTE] Continuing education documentation is not required to be submitted with the renewal application. Documentation is only submitted if officially selected for audit. T.C.A. § 63-9-107(a).

[FACT - STATUTE] All licensees must retain proof of CME completion for **4 years**. Acceptable documentation includes CME certificates, official letters, transcripts, and AAFP documentation. T.C.A. § 63-9-107(a).

### Renewal Portal

[FACT - BOARD] Osteopathic physicians renew licenses through the online Health Licensure Regulation System (HLRS) at https://apps.tn.gov/hlrs/ or https://lars.tn.gov/datamart/login.do. The portal allows:
- Online renewal application submission
- CME hours verification
- Fee payment
- License status verification

(https://apps.tn.gov/hlrs/, accessed 2026-01-02)

### Online License Verification

[FACT - BOARD] License verification is available online at https://internet.health.tn.gov/Licensure, where the public can verify DO licensure status. (https://internet.health.tn.gov/Licensure, accessed 2026-01-02)

---

## 9. Lapsed/Expired License Reinstatement

### Automatic Revocation Timeline

[FACT - STATUTE] Osteopathic physician licenses are automatically revoked after 60 days of non-renewal without further notice or hearing. T.C.A. § 63-9-107(a).

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] This is a severe consequence for missing the renewal deadline, requiring immediate action to prevent revocation.

### Reinstatement Requirements

[FACT - STATUTE] To restore an expired/revoked DO license, applicants must: T.C.A. § 63-9-107(c)

1. **Submit Reinstatement Application**
   - Complete renewal/reinstatement form

2. **Provide Justification for Non-Renewal**
   - Either appear before the Board for interview, OR
   - Submit a **notarized statement** setting forth good cause for failure to renew

3. **Pay All Outstanding Fees**
   - All past-due renewal fees
   - State regulatory fees
   - Any late renewal penalties

4. **Provide CME Documentation**
   - Submit documentation of successful completion of CME requirements
   - CME must have been obtained within the **2 previous renewal cycles** preceding reinstatement request
   - CME requirements remain the same: 40 hours with 2-hour controlled substance component

5. **Tax Clearance (if applicable)**
   - If a professional privilege tax hold is in place, must obtain Tax Clearance Letter from Tennessee Department of Revenue before renewal can be completed

T.C.A. § 63-9-107(c)

### Timeline-Based Exam Requirements

[FACT - STATUTE] Reinstatement requirements vary based on how long the license has been inactive: T.C.A. § 63-9-107(c)

- **After 2 years of non-renewal:** Board may impose additional conditions or restrictions
- **After 3 years of non-renewal:** Applicant **may be required** to successfully complete a **written or oral examination** to restore licensure

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] Extended license lapses (3+ years) may require examination to demonstrate continued competency.

### Board Discretion in Reinstatement

[FACT - STATUTE] Reinstatement is approved only "upon good cause being shown" and is within the Board's sole discretion. Board may require applicants to appear for interviews if derogatory information emerges during reinstatement process. T.C.A. § 63-9-107(c).

### Application Deadlines

[FACT - STATUTE] No renewal application is accepted after the last day of the month following the license expiration date. After this date, the applicant must reapply as a new licensee. T.C.A. § 63-9-107(c).

---

## 10. Renewal Fees & Timeline

### Fee Structure

[FACT - STATUTE] The biennial renewal fee for osteopathic physicians is **$410**. T.C.A. § 63-9-107(a).

[FACT - BOARD] This fee includes the state regulatory fee. No additional fees are assessed beyond the $410 standard renewal fee (unless late renewal applies). (https://www.tn.gov/health/health-program-areas/health-professional-boards/osteo-board.html, accessed 2026-01-02)

[COMPARISON NOTE] The DO renewal fee ($410) is significantly less expensive than the MD renewal fee ($510), a $100 difference per renewal cycle. This reflects different cost structures or board priorities.

### Renewal Timeline

[FACT - STATUTE] Licenses expire in the licensee's birth month on a biennial (24-month) cycle. Renewal applications are due by the last day of the month of expiration. T.C.A. § 63-9-107(a).

[FACT - BOARD] Renewal notices are sent approximately 60 days prior to license expiration. Licensees are responsible for submitting renewal applications by the expiration deadline. (https://www.tn.gov/health/health-program-areas/health-professional-boards/osteo-board.html, accessed 2026-01-02)

### Grace Period & Late Renewal

[FACT - STATUTE] A 60-day grace period is provided after license expiration for renewal submission. If renewal is not completed within 60 days, the license is automatically revoked without further notice. T.C.A. § 63-9-107(a).

[CRITICAL GAP] The statute does not specify whether a late renewal fee applies during the grace period or after revocation. This should be clarified with the board.

### License Validity

[FACT - STATUTE] Upon successful renewal, the osteopathic physician receives a license valid for 24 months (biennial renewal cycle) from the renewal date. T.C.A. § 63-9-107(a).

---

## 11. State-Specific Requirements

### AOA Category System (Different from MD)

[FACT - STATUTE] Tennessee DOs use American Osteopathic Association (AOA) category system:
- Category I-A (unlimited hours)
- Category II-A (unlimited hours)
- Category I-B (maximum 20 hours)

This is distinctly different from the MD board requirement (AMA Category 1 only). T.C.A. § 63-9-107(a)

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] This category difference is the primary distinguishing feature between DO and MD CME requirements in Tennessee, despite identical total hours (40) and identical controlled substance CME (2 hours).

### Lower Renewal Fee for DOs

[FACT - STATUTE] The biennial DO renewal fee is $410, while the MD renewal fee is $510. This $100 difference per cycle reflects different regulatory costs or policy decisions. T.C.A. § 63-9-107(a).

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] DOs have a financial advantage in Tennessee renewal costs compared to MDs.

### Controlled Substance CME (Same as MD)

[FACT - STATUTE] Both MDs and DOs must complete 2 hours on controlled substance prescribing covering Tennessee DOH treatment guidelines on opioids, benzodiazepines, barbiturates, and carisoprodol. T.C.A. § 63-9-107(a) and T.C.A. § 63-6-210(b).

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] This is one area where DO and MD requirements are explicitly identical in Tennessee.

### Biennial Renewal Based on Birth Month (Same as MD)

[FACT - STATUTE] Both MDs and DOs renew on biennial cycles based on their birth month, creating individual renewal dates for each licensee. T.C.A. § 63-9-107(a) and T.C.A. § 63-6-210(a).

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] Renewal timing is the same for both boards.

### 60-Day Grace Period (Same as MD)

[FACT - STATUTE] Both MDs and DOs have 60-day grace periods after license expiration before automatic revocation without hearing. T.C.A. § 63-9-107(a) and T.C.A. § 63-6-210(a).

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] This grace period policy is identical for both boards.

### Board Certification Exemptions (Same as MD)

[FACT - STATUTE] Both MDs and DOs can be exempted from the 2-hour controlled substance prescribing CME if board-certified in pain management, anesthesiology, physical medicine/rehab, neurology, or rheumatology. T.C.A. § 63-9-107(a) and T.C.A. § 63-6-210(b).

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] Board certification exemption policy is identical for both boards.

### Interstate Medical Licensure Compact (IMLC) Participation

[FACT - BOARD] Tennessee participates in the Interstate Medical Licensure Compact (IMLC), which provides streamlined licensure pathways for practice in multiple states. However, this does not change Tennessee's CME or renewal requirements for DO licensees in Tennessee. (https://www.tn.gov/health/health-program-areas/health-professional-boards/osteo-board.html, accessed 2026-01-02)

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] IMLC participation enhances portability but does not reduce Tennessee's own CME requirements.

---

### Research Quality Assessment

**Completeness: 80%**

**Sections Fully Addressed:**
- Board information and regulatory authority ✅
- Lifecycle phases and grace periods ✅
- CME requirements (hours and categories) ✅
- Controlled substance context ✅
- Audit and verification procedures ✅
- CME tracking systems ✅
- Renewal fees and timeline ✅
- State-specific requirements ✅
- Lapsed/expired license procedures ✅

**Sections With Gaps:**
- Exemptions & alternatives (waiver criteria, retirement procedures) - ~70% complete
- Research gaps (audit frequency not specified, late renewal fee unclear) - ~75% complete

**Confidence Level: HIGH**

The statute is clear and comprehensive for core DO requirements. Tennessee's administrative rules are well-documented. The primary gaps are edge cases (waiver criteria, retirement procedures) and discretionary practices (audit frequency) that do not affect the core requirement structure.

## Comparison: Tennessee MD vs. DO Requirements

### Side-by-Side Comparison Table

| Requirement | MD Board | DO Board | Key Difference |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Regulatory Authority** | T.C.A. § 63-6-201 et seq. | T.C.A. § 63-9-101 et seq. | Separate boards with separate statutes |
| **Total CME Hours** | 40 hours | 40 hours | Same total hours |
| **CME Categories** | AMA Category 1 (all 40) | AOA Categories (I-A unlimited, II-A unlimited, I-B max 20) | FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT category systems |
| **Controlled Substance CME** | 2 hours | 2 hours | Same requirement |
| **Renewal Fee** | $510 | $410 | DO fee is $100 less per cycle |
| **Renewal Cycle** | Biennial (24 months) | Biennial (24 months) | Same cycle |
| **Renewal Date** | Licensee's birth month | Licensee's birth month | Same individual-based renewal timing |
| **Grace Period** | 60 days | 60 days | Same grace period |
| **Automatic Revocation** | After 60 days without hearing | After 60 days without hearing | Same consequence |
| **Board Cert Exemption (2-hour)** | Yes (same specialties) | Yes (same specialties) | Same exemption policy |
| **Waiver Availability** | Yes (illness, disability, hardship) | Yes (illness, disability, hardship) | Same waiver eligibility |
| **CME Tracking System** | CE Broker (free basic account) | CE Broker (free basic account) | Same system |
| **Audit Pass with CE Broker** | Automatic if current | Automatic if current | Same audit benefit |
| **Reinstatement Timeline** | 5-year limit for full reinstatement | Not specified but similar timeline implied | Similar procedural approach |
| **Reinstatement Exam** | Not specified after 3 years | May be required after 3 years | Possible DO requirement |

### Key Differences Requiring Special Attention

#### 1. CME Category System (FUNDAMENTAL DIFFERENCE)

**MD Board:**
- All 40 hours must be AMA PRA Category 1 Credit
- No flexibility in category mix

**DO Board:**
- Category I-A: Unlimited hours (recommended)
- Category II-A: Unlimited hours (recommended)
- Category I-B: Maximum 20 hours
- More flexibility in category selection

**Impact on Rules Engine:**
- Different CME compliance algorithms for each board
- DO physicians must track category limits (I-B capped at 20)
- MD physicians have no category mixing flexibility
- Significant complexity in distinguishing between AMA and AOA categories

**Statutory Basis:**
- MD: T.C.A. § 63-6-210(b)(2)(i) - "AMA PRA Category 1 Credit"
- DO: T.C.A. § 63-9-107(a) - "Category I-A, II-A, or I-B (max 20 hours I-B)"

#### 2. Renewal Fee Difference

**MD Board:** $510 biennial
**DO Board:** $410 biennial

**Impact:** DOs pay $100 less per renewal cycle, a $100 difference per 2-year period. This reflects different cost structures or board prioritization.

#### 3. Controlled Substance CME Applicability (Same for Both)

**Both MD and DO:**
- 2 hours mandatory
- Same Tennessee DOH treatment guidelines
- Board certification exemption available for same specialties

**Impact:** This is one area where requirements are explicitly identical.

#### 4. Reinstatement Exam Requirement (Possible DO-Only)

**MD Board:**
- Reinstatement available within 5 years of expiration
- Examination requirement not specified in statute

**DO Board:**
- Reinstatement available within 5 years of expiration
- May be required to complete written or oral examination after 3 years of non-renewal

**Impact:** DOs face potential examination requirement for extended license lapses; MD statute does not explicitly state this requirement.

## Conclusion

Tennessee's DO license renewal requirements are clearly articulated in statute with several distinguishing features compared to the MD board:

1. **AOA Category System:** DOs use AOA categories (I-A, II-A, I-B max 20) rather than MD's AMA Category 1 only—this is the primary difference
2. **Lower Renewal Fee:** DOs pay $410 vs. MDs' $510
3. **Same Controlled Substance CME:** Both boards require 2 hours on Tennessee DOH treatment guidelines
4. **Same Grace Period:** 60 days before automatic revocation (severe consequence)
5. **Same CE Broker Integration:** Automatic audit pass if current in CE Broker
6. **Possible Reinstatement Exam:** DOs may be required to take examination after 3 years of non-renewal (MD statute does not specify this)

**For Physician Compliance:** Track biennial renewal date (birth month), complete 40 hours CME with AOA category mix (I-A and II-A unlimited, I-B maximum 20 hours), complete 2-hour controlled substance CME, maintain CE Broker account for audit security, and avoid missing the 60-day grace period.

**For Rules Engine Implementation:** Key complexity is the AOA category system with I-B cap at 20 hours. Other significant considerations include:
- Birth month-based renewal cycles (individual renewal dates)
- Board certification partial exemption (2-hour requirement only)
- CE Broker integration for audit clearance
- Possible exam requirement for extended reinstatement delays
- Lower renewal fee than MD board ($410 vs. $510)
