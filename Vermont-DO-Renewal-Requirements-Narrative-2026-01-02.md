## 1. Board Information & Regulatory Authority

### Official Board Information

[FACT - BOARD] The Vermont Board of Osteopathic Physicians and Surgeons is the official regulatory agency for osteopathic physicians in Vermont. Website: https://sos.vermont.gov/osteopathic-physicians/. Phone: (802) 828-1505 or (802) 828-2373. Address: 89 Main Street, Montpelier, VT 05602. Hours: 7:45 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., Monday-Friday. (Accessed 2026-01-02)

[FACT - STATUTE] The board is a 5-member board appointed by the Governor. Board structure consists of 3 professional members (osteopathic physicians) and 2 public members. 26 V.S.A. § 1831(a).

[CRITICAL DIFFERENCE] The Vermont Board of Osteopathic Physicians and Surgeons is located in the Vermont Secretary of State's Office of Professional Regulation (OPR), NOT the Department of Health. This is fundamentally different from the MD board, which is in the Department of Health. 26 V.S.A. Chapter 33.

### Primary Statutory Framework

[FACT - STATUTE] Vermont Statutes Annotated § 1836 is the primary statute governing continuing medical education requirements and license renewal for osteopathic physicians. Full citation: 26 V.S.A. § 1836 (Renewal of License; Continuing Medical Education). Source: https://legislature.vermont.gov/statutes/

[FACT - ADMIN_CODE] Code Vermont Rules 3-Osteo provides detailed implementation requirements for osteopathic physician licensing and CME compliance. Citation: Code Vt. R. 3-Osteo (Rules of the Board of Osteopathic Physicians and Surgeons).

[FACT - STATUTE] 26 V.S.A. Chapter 3, Section 005 applies general professional regulations to all regulated professions under the OPR, including osteopathic physicians. 26 V.S.A. Chapter 3, § 005.

### Split-Board State Identification

[FACT - STATUTE] Vermont maintains completely separate regulatory structures for MD and DO physicians:
- **Vermont Board of Medical Practice** (26 V.S.A. § 1351 et seq., Department of Health) regulates allopathic physicians
- **Vermont Board of Osteopathic Physicians and Surgeons** (26 V.S.A. § 1831 et seq., Secretary of State OPR) regulates osteopathic physicians

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] This is a SPLIT-BOARD STATE with fundamentally different regulatory structures. The two boards are in different state agencies (Department of Health vs. Secretary of State), have different CME requirements, and different fee structures. This is one of the most structurally separated split-board systems in the nation.

---

## 2. Lifecycle Phases & Grace Periods

### Standard Renewal Timeline

[FACT - STATUTE] Vermont osteopathic physician licenses are renewed on a biennial (2-year) cycle. Licenses expire on a fixed date: **November 30 of even-numbered years**. 26 V.S.A. § 1836(a).

[FACT - STATUTE] The renewal cycle period is December 1 - November 30 of each two-year licensing period. 26 V.S.A. § 1836(a).

[FACT - BOARD] Renewal applications open 6 weeks prior to license expiration. Courtesy notification is sent to licensee's email address on file. (https://sos.vermont.gov/osteopathic-physicians/, accessed 2026-01-02)

### Grace Period & Late Renewal

[FACT - STATUTE] No formal grace period is identified in Vermont statute for osteopathic physicians. However, late renewal penalties apply, suggesting a brief window for submission after expiration. 26 V.S.A. § 1836(a).

[FACT - STATUTE] Late renewal penalties apply on a graduated schedule:
- $25.00 for renewals submitted less than 30 days late
- Additional $5.00 for every month or fraction thereof thereafter
- Maximum penalty cap: $100.00 total

26 V.S.A. § 1836(a)

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] While no explicit grace period is stated, the late renewal penalty structure implies licensees can submit applications after November 30 and before the maximum penalty is reached. However, practicing with a lapsed license is prohibited.

### License Expiration & Lapse

[FACT - STATUTE] Upon expiration (November 30), the license lapses if renewal requirements are not met. The osteopathic physician cannot legally practice in Vermont with a lapsed license. 26 V.S.A. § 1836(a).

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] This is identical to the MD board policy—no grace period, immediate practice prohibition upon expiration.

---

## 3. CME Requirements - Total Hours & Categories

### Total CME Hours Required

[FACT - STATUTE] Vermont requires 30 credit hours of continuing medical education per biennial renewal cycle for osteopathic physicians. 26 V.S.A. § 1836(b).

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] Vermont's 30-hour requirement matches the MD board requirement, making this one area where DO and MD requirements are explicitly identical.

### CME Category Specification - Osteopathic Emphasis

[FACT - STATUTE] Of the 30 required hours, a minimum of 40% (12 hours) must be "osteopathic medical education." The remaining 60% (18 hours) can be other Board-approved CME. 26 V.S.A. § 1836(b).

[FACT - STATUTE] Osteopathic medical education is defined as educational activities focused on:
- Osteopathic principles
- Osteopathic manipulative medicine (OMT)
- Topics specific to osteopathic medicine

26 V.S.A. § 1836(b)

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] This 40% osteopathic requirement is unique to the DO board and does not apply to the MD board, creating a fundamental difference in CME structure.

### Approved CME Providers

[FACT - STATUTE] Vermont accepts CME from:
- **AOA (American Osteopathic Association)** - Category 1 credits (both 1-A and 1-B)
- **ACCME-accredited providers** awarding AMA PRA Category 1 Credit™
- **Equivalent organizations** approved by the Vermont Board
- **AOA Category 2-A and 2-B** (allopathic CME) appears acceptable for the non-osteopathic portion

26 V.S.A. § 1836(b)

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] Vermont's approach allows flexibility in CME source, accepting both osteopathic (AOA) and allopathic (ACCME) accreditation.

---

## 4. CME Topic Requirements

### Mandatory Controlled Substance Prescribing CME

[FACT - STATUTE] Osteopathic physicians with DEA registration must complete a minimum of 2 hours of CME per renewal cycle on safe and effective prescribing of controlled substances. Topics must include pain management and related content. 26 V.S.A. § 1836(b).

[FACT - STATUTE] The 2-hour controlled substance CME applies only to licensees who:
- Have active DEA registration, OR
- Have a pending DEA application, OR
- Dispense controlled substances

26 V.S.A. § 1836(b)

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] This requirement is identical to the MD board approach—conditional on DEA registration.

### Federal Opioid Requirement (One-Time)

[FACT - STATUTE] In addition to the biennial 30-hour CME, all DEA-registered practitioners (including DOs) must complete an 8-hour one-time training on treatment and management of patients with opioid or other substance use disorders. This requirement became effective June 27, 2023. 26 V.S.A. § 1836(b).

[FACT - STATUTE] The 8-hour training is a one-time requirement, not recurring with each license renewal. 26 V.S.A. § 1836(b).

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] This is a federal requirement (Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2023) that Vermont enforces for all DEA-registered practitioners, including DOs.

### No Other Mandatory Topics

[CRITICAL GAP] The statute does not specify other mandatory CME topics for non-DEA licensees beyond the 40% osteopathic medical education requirement. Unlike the MD board, which requires 1 hour of palliative/pain care, the DO board does not appear to mandate this topic.

---

## 5. Controlled Substance Context

### Controlled Substance Prescribing CME

[FACT - STATUTE] Osteopathic physicians with DEA registration must complete 2 hours of CME on safe and effective prescribing of controlled substances, pain management, and related topics. 26 V.S.A. § 1836(b).

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] This requirement is identical in scope and hours to the MD board requirement.

### Substance Use Disorder Treatment Training

[FACT - STATUTE] All DEA-registered osteopathic practitioners must complete an 8-hour one-time training on treatment and management of opioid and substance use disorders (federal MATE Act requirement, effective June 27, 2023). This is separate from and in addition to the biennial CME. 26 V.S.A. § 1836(b).

### Verification of Completion

[FACT - STATUTE] Licensees must show evidence of completion of the 8-hour substance use disorder training in response to Board request. 26 V.S.A. § 1836(b).

---

## 6. Audit & Verification Procedures

### Audit Authority & Lookback Period

[FACT - STATUTE] The Board maintains a 4-year lookback authority for CME audits from the time of submission. 26 V.S.A. § 1836(b).

[FACT - STATUTE] Licensees must retain CME documentation for verification purposes. The Board may request documentation at any time within the 4-year period. 26 V.S.A. § 1836(b).

[CRITICAL GAP] The statute does not specify the percentage of renewals audited (e.g., random sample, discretionary). Audit frequency should be clarified with the board.

### Verification Procedures

[FACT - STATUTE] Licensees must promptly submit documentation of CME completion upon Board request. 26 V.S.A. § 1836(b).

[FACT - STATUTE] Acceptable documentation includes:
- Certificates of completion from approved CME providers
- Course transcripts from ACCME or AOA-accredited providers
- Attendance records and proof of participation

26 V.S.A. § 1836(b)

### Non-Compliance Consequences

[FACT - STATUTE] Failure to complete required CME hours results in suspension of all professional privileges. Suspension becomes effective on the license expiration date if renewal requirements are not met. 26 V.S.A. § 1836(b).

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] Vermont enforces CME requirements strictly—non-compliance results in automatic suspension upon license expiration.

---

## 7. Exemptions & Alternatives

### Board Certification Exemptions

[CRITICAL GAP] Vermont statutes and administrative code do not provide an explicit board certification exemption from CME requirements. Based on statute review, board certification does NOT exempt osteopathic physicians from the 30-hour CME requirement or the 40% osteopathic medical education component. All licensed DOs must meet full requirements regardless of board certification status.

### New Licensee Considerations

[CRITICAL GAP] The statute does not specify pro-rata CME requirements for osteopathic physicians obtaining licensure mid-cycle. New licensee CME requirements should be clarified with the board.

### Professional Scope & Limitations

[FACT - STATUTE] Osteopathic physicians licensed in Vermont have equivalent professional scope to allopathic physicians. Both can prescribe medications, perform surgeries, and practice medicine equivalently. 26 V.S.A. § 1836 et seq.

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] Vermont grants DOs full medical licensure with equivalent rights to MDs, not limited licensure.

---

## 8. CME Tracking Systems

### Online OPR System

[FACT - BOARD] Osteopathic physicians submit CME documentation and renewal applications through the Vermont Secretary of State's Office of Professional Regulation (OPR) online system. Website: https://sos.vermont.gov/opr/online-services/. (Accessed 2026-01-02)

[FACT - BOARD] All applications must be submitted through the OPR online system; paper applications are no longer accepted. (https://sos.vermont.gov/osteopathic-physicians/, accessed 2026-01-02)

### No Mandatory Third-Party Tracking

[CRITICAL GAP] Vermont does not mandate a specific third-party CME tracking service (e.g., CE Broker). Unlike many states that provide free tracking accounts or integration, Vermont DOs are responsible for selecting their own tracking methods.

### Documentation Retention

[FACT - STATUTE] Osteopathic physicians must maintain CME documentation for verification purposes. The Board may request documentation within the 4-year audit lookback period. 26 V.S.A. § 1836(b).

### Virtual CME Acceptance

[FACT - BOARD] Recent Vermont legislation allows synchronous virtual continuing education courses to qualify for renewal. Virtual CME is accepted on the same basis as in-person CME. (https://sos.vermont.gov/osteopathic-physicians/, accessed 2026-01-02)

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] This reflects modern acceptance of virtual learning, important for rural Vermont practitioners.

---

## 9. Lapsed/Expired License Reinstatement

### No Grace Period - Immediate Lapse

[FACT - STATUTE] There is NO formal grace period for osteopathic physician renewal. If renewal is not completed by November 30, the license lapses. Osteopathic physicians cannot practice in Vermont with a lapsed license. 26 V.S.A. § 1836(a).

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] This is identical to the MD board policy—strict enforcement of November 30 deadline with no grace period.

### Reinstatement Within One Year

[FACT - STATUTE] If an osteopathic physician's license has lapsed for less than one year, reinstatement is available through the following process:

1. **Submit full renewal application** (not simplified reinstatement application)
2. **Provide proof of CME completion** for the prior period
3. **Tender late renewal fee** in addition to regular renewal fee
4. **Submit all required documentation** for license reinstatement

26 V.S.A. § 1836(c)

### Reinstatement After One Year

[FACT - STATUTE] If an osteopathic physician's license has been lapsed for one year or more, the following may apply:

1. **Director may impose additional professional qualification requirements**
2. **May require reexamination** to demonstrate current competency
3. **May require proof of recent practice** or additional training if licensee hasn't practiced for 3+ years
4. **Must halt all practice completely** until reinstatement is approved (more restrictive than < 1 year lapse)

26 V.S.A. § 1836(c)

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] Extended license lapses (≥ 1 year) carry significant additional burden and potential reexamination requirement.

### Practice Restrictions

[FACT - STATUTE] Osteopathic physicians cannot legally practice in Vermont after license lapses. Must halt all practice immediately and completely until reinstatement. 26 V.S.A. § 1836(a).

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] This is stricter than states with grace periods allowing limited practice during reinstatement.

---

## 10. Renewal Fees & Timeline

### Fee Structure

[CRITICAL GAP] Specific renewal fee amounts are NOT clearly documented in accessible statute excerpts. The board appears to charge renewal fees and late penalties, but exact amounts are not specified in the statute reviewed. **Renewal fee amounts should be clarified by contacting the Vermont Board of Osteopathic Physicians and Surgeons directly.**

### Late Renewal Penalties

[FACT - STATUTE] Late renewal penalties are assessed on a graduated schedule:
- **$25.00** for renewals submitted less than 30 days late
- **Additional $5.00** for every month or fraction thereof thereafter
- **Maximum penalty cap: $100.00** total

26 V.S.A. § 1836(a)

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] These penalties create a 20-month window before reaching the $100 penalty cap, suggesting licensees have extended time to submit late renewals if willing to pay penalties.

### Renewal Timeline

[FACT - STATUTE] Licenses expire on November 30 of even-numbered years. Renewal cycle is December 1 - November 30. 26 V.S.A. § 1836(a).

[FACT - BOARD] Renewal applications open 6 weeks prior to license expiration (approximately October 15). Courtesy notification is sent by email. (https://sos.vermont.gov/osteopathic-physicians/, accessed 2026-01-02)

### License Validity

[FACT - STATUTE] Upon successful renewal, the osteopathic physician receives a license valid for 2 years (24 months), expiring November 30 of the next even-numbered year. 26 V.S.A. § 1836(a).

---

## 11. State-Specific Requirements

### Regulatory Agency Difference (Secretary of State, Not Department of Health)

[FACT - STATUTE] Vermont Board of Osteopathic Physicians and Surgeons is located in the Vermont Secretary of State's Office of Professional Regulation, NOT the Department of Health. This is fundamentally different from the MD board. 26 V.S.A. Chapter 33.

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] This structural difference creates separate regulatory pathways, contact information, renewal processes, and fee structures for DOs vs. MDs.

### Osteopathic Medical Education Emphasis (40% Minimum)

[FACT - STATUTE] Vermont requires a minimum of 40% (12 hours) of the 30-hour CME requirement to be "osteopathic medical education." This is unique to Vermont's DO board and reflects emphasis on osteopathic-specific training. 26 V.S.A. § 1836(b).

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] This requirement distinguishes DOs from MDs and requires careful CME selection to meet the osteopathic education mandate.

### Five-Member Board Structure

[FACT - STATUTE] The Vermont Board of Osteopathic Physicians and Surgeons is a 5-member board (3 professional, 2 public members), smaller than the MD board's 17-member structure. 26 V.S.A. § 1831(a).

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] Smaller board size may result in faster decision-making but less representation of diverse medical perspectives.

### Virtual CME Acceptance

[FACT - BOARD] Recent Vermont legislation accepts synchronous virtual continuing education courses for CME credit on the same basis as in-person CME. (https://sos.vermont.gov/osteopathic-physicians/, accessed 2026-01-02)

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] This modernizes Vermont's approach and accommodates rural practitioners' needs.

### Online-Only Renewal System

[FACT - BOARD] All renewal applications must be submitted through the OPR online system. Paper applications are no longer accepted. (https://sos.vermont.gov/osteopathic-physicians/, accessed 2026-01-02)

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] Digital-only system may create barriers for practitioners unfamiliar with online platforms but reduces administrative burden.

---

## 12. CME Tracking & Reporting Systems

### OPR Online Portal

[FACT - BOARD] Osteopathic physicians submit renewal applications and CME documentation through the Vermont Secretary of State's OPR online portal at https://sos.vermont.gov/opr/online-services/. (Accessed 2026-01-02)

[FACT - BOARD] The portal allows physicians to manage their license renewal, submit CME documentation, and receive board notifications. (https://sos.vermont.gov/opr/online-services/, accessed 2026-01-02)

### No Mandatory Third-Party System

[CRITICAL GAP] Vermont does not mandate or provide a specific third-party CME tracking service (unlike states that provide free CE Broker accounts). Osteopathic physicians are responsible for selecting their own tracking and documentation methods.

### Documentation Retention

[FACT - STATUTE] Osteopathic physicians must maintain CME documentation for the 4-year audit lookback period. Board may request documentation at any time within this window. 26 V.S.A. § 1836(b).

### Audit-Based Verification Model

[FACT - STATUTE] Vermont uses an audit-based verification model. Licensees are not required to submit CME documentation with renewal applications. Documentation is submitted only when officially requested by the Board during an audit. 26 V.S.A. § 1836(b).

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] This trust-based model reduces compliance burden but places documentation responsibility on individual physicians.

---

### Key Differences Requiring Special Attention

#### 1. Regulatory Agency (STRUCTURAL DIFFERENCE)

**MD Board:**
- Located in Vermont Department of Health
- Board of Medical Practice
- Regulated under health regulatory framework

**DO Board:**
- Located in Vermont Secretary of State's Office of Professional Regulation (OPR)
- Board of Osteopathic Physicians and Surgeons
- Regulated under professional regulation framework

**Impact on Rules Engine:**
- Different regulatory contact information
- Different renewal portal (though both may use online systems)
- Different fee structures (MD known $525; DO unknown)
- Different board sizes (MD 17 members; DO 5 members)
- Different statutory chapters (MD 26 V.S.A. Chapter 23; DO 26 V.S.A. Chapter 33)

**Statutory Basis:**
- MD: 26 V.S.A. § 1351 (Department of Health)
- DO: 26 V.S.A. § 1831 (Secretary of State OPR)

#### 2. CME Category Structure (FUNDAMENTAL DIFFERENCE)

**MD Board:**
- 30 hours AMA Category 1 only
- No flexibility in category mix

**DO Board:**
- Minimum 40% (12 hours) osteopathic medical education
- Remaining 60% (18 hours) other approved CME
- Flexibility in category selection within parameters

**Impact on Rules Engine:**
- Different CME tracking logic for each board
- DO physicians must track osteopathic education component separately
- MD physicians cannot receive credit for osteopathic courses
- Significant difference in CME source requirements

**Statutory Basis:**
- MD: 26 V.S.A. § 1400(b) - "AMA PRA Category 1 Credit"
- DO: 26 V.S.A. § 1836(b) - "40% osteopathic medical education minimum"

#### 3. Mandatory Topic Differences

**MD Board:**
- 1 hour palliative/pain care (mandatory for all)
- 2 hours controlled substance prescribing (DEA registrants only)

**DO Board:**
- No specified mandatory topics beyond 40% osteopathic education requirement
- 2 hours controlled substance prescribing (DEA registrants only)

**Impact:**
- MDs must complete palliative care education; DOs do not (unless selected osteopathic education addresses this)
- Reflects different public health priorities between boards

## Conclusion

Vermont's DO license renewal requirements are clearly articulated with several distinguishing features compared to the MD board:

1. **Different Regulatory Agency:** DO board under Secretary of State OPR, not Department of Health (structural separation)
2. **Osteopathic Education Requirement:** 40% minimum (12 of 30 hours) must be osteopathic-specific education
3. **Same Total Hours:** 30 hours biennial, matching MD requirement
4. **Same Controlled Substance CME:** 2 hours for DEA registrants + 8-hour federal SUD training
5. **Same Fixed Renewal Date:** November 30 of even years
6. **No Grace Period:** Strict enforcement like MD board
7. **Audit-Based Verification:** CME documentation submitted upon audit request only
8. **Full Professional Equivalence:** DOs have equivalent rights and scope as MDs

**For Physician Compliance:** Track November 30 renewal deadline with no grace period, complete 30 hours CME with minimum 40% (12 hours) being osteopathic medical education, complete 2-hour controlled substance CME if DEA registered, complete 8-hour federal opioid training (one-time if DEA registered), maintain CME documentation for 4-year audit period, and ensure proper submission through OPR online portal.

**For Rules Engine Implementation:** Key complexity areas are:
- Different regulatory agency (separate contact, separate fees, separate portal)
- Osteopathic education component tracking (40% minimum requirement)
- No mandated CME tracking service (physician responsibility)
- Audit-based verification model
- Stricter reinstatement requirements for extended lapses (≥ 1 year)
- Fee structure and amounts (not publicly documented; must contact board)
- Small 5-member board vs. larger MD board structure
