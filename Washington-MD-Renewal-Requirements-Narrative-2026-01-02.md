  rationale: "Washington is a split-board state with DRAMATICALLY DIFFERENT renewal cycles between MD and DO. MD board requires 200 hrs/4yr (quadrennial) while DO board requires 150 hrs/3yr (triennial). Different cycle lengths create significant complexity. Both have mandatory suicide assessment training (6 hrs one-time) and health equity CME (2 hrs per cycle). The different renewal frequencies (4-year vs 3-year) and different total hours create split-board complexity requiring separate research."

  why_tier_2: "Split-board complexity with different renewal cycles (4-year vs 3-year). High total hours (200 MD, 150 DO) create compliance burden. Requires separate research documents."

**Key Findings:**

- **CME Requirement:** 200 hours every 4 years (quadrennial - highest quadrennial total nationally)
  - May include mix of Categories 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 (max 80 hrs each of Cat 2/3/4/5)
  - [FACT - ADMIN_CODE: WAC 246-919-460]
- **Mandatory Topics:**
  - **Suicide assessment/treatment/management:** 6 hours one-time [FACT - STATUTE: RCW 43.70.442]
  - **Health equity:** 2 hours per renewal cycle [FACT - STATUTE: RCW 43.70.613]
  - **Opioid prescribing:** 1 hour one-time (for prescribers) [FACT - ADMIN_CODE]
- **Renewal Frequency:** Quadrennial (every 4 years)
- **Board Cert Alternative:** ABMS or ABOMS MOC program satisfies CME requirement
- **Split-Board Complexity:** DO board has 3-year cycle (150 hrs/3yr) vs MD 4-year cycle (200 hrs/4yr)

## 1. Board Information & Regulatory Authority

[FACT - BOARD] The Washington Medical Commission is the official regulatory agency for allopathic physicians (MDs) in Washington.

**Contact Information:**
- Website: https://wmc.wa.gov
- Phone: (360) 236-4700
- Renewal Portal: https://fortress.wa.gov/doh/providercredentialing/
- Email: customerservice.hpqa@doh.wa.gov

### Primary Statutory Framework

[FACT - STATUTE] RCW 18.71.095 governs continuing medical education requirements for Washington MD physicians.

[FACT - ADMIN_CODE] WAC 246-919-460 provides detailed CME implementation requirements.

### Split-Board State

[FACT - STATUTE] Washington maintains separate boards:
- **MD Board:** Washington Medical Commission (WMC) - 200 hrs/4yr
- **DO Board:** Washington Board of Osteopathic Medicine and Surgery (WBOMS) - 150 hrs/3yr

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] Different cycle lengths (4-year vs 3-year) create alignment complexity every 12 years when cycles synchronize.

---

## 2. CME Requirements - Total Hours & Categories

[FACT - ADMIN_CODE] Washington requires **200 hours of CME every 4 years** (quadrennial renewal).

Citation: WAC 246-919-460
Annual Equivalent: 50 hours per year

### Category Flexibility

[FACT - ADMIN_CODE] Washington accepts mixed CME categories:
- **Category 1:** Formal CME from ACCME-accredited providers (unlimited)
- **Category 2, 3, 4, 5:** Maximum 80 hours each category

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] Physicians can mix categories flexibly (e.g., 120 hrs Cat 1 + 80 hrs Cat 2 = 200 total).

---

## 3. Mandatory Topics

### Suicide Assessment, Treatment, and Management (6 Hours One-Time)

[FACT - STATUTE] All physicians must complete **6 hours of suicide assessment, treatment, and management training** ONE TIME.

Citation: RCW 43.70.442
Effective Date: July 24, 2016
Applicability: All licensed physicians (one-time requirement)

**Content:**
- Suicide screening and assessment
- Treatment planning
- Crisis intervention
- Referral procedures

### Health Equity CME (2 Hours Per Cycle)

[FACT - STATUTE] All physicians must complete **2 hours of health equity CME per renewal cycle**.

Citation: RCW 43.70.613
Frequency: Every 4 years (per renewal cycle)
Applicability: All licensed physicians

**Content:**
- Implicit bias
- Structural racism
- Health disparities
- Cultural competency

### Opioid Prescribing CME (1 Hour One-Time)

[FACT - ADMIN_CODE] Physicians with prescribing authority must complete **1 hour of opioid prescribing education** ONE TIME.

Frequency: One-time (when obtaining prescribing authority)
Applicability: Physicians who prescribe controlled substances

**Content:**
- CDC opioid prescribing guidelines
- PDMP usage
- Safe prescribing practices

---

## 4. Exemptions & Alternatives

### Board Certification / MOC Alternative

[FACT - ADMIN_CODE] Physicians participating in **ABMS or ABOMS Maintenance of Certification (MOC) programs** satisfy CME requirements.

**Accepted Boards:**
- American Board of Medical Specialties (ABMS) MOC
- American Board of Osteopathic Medical Specialties (ABOMS) MOC (for MD physicians)

**Scope:** Full exemption from 200-hour requirement during active MOC participation

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] MOC participation provides complete CME exemption, including mandatory topics (suicide, health equity, opioid).

---

## 5. Renewal Timeline & Fees

[FACT - BOARD] Washington medical licenses are renewed **quadrennially (every 4 years)**.

**Renewal Fee:** $664 (standard renewal)
**Late Renewal Fee:** [MEDIUM GAP - amount not specified in accessible sources]

**Grace Period:** 90 days after expiration (license inactive during grace period)

---

## 6. Audit & Verification

[FACT - BOARD] Washington conducts **random audits** of CME compliance.

[HIGH GAP] Audit frequency and selection percentage not specified.

**Audit Documentation:**
- CME certificates with provider, hours, dates
- MOC participation records (if applicable)

## 7. Split-Board Comparison: MD vs DO

| Factor | MD (WMC) | DO (WBOMS) |
|--------|----------|------------|
| Total Hours | 200 hrs/4yr | 150 hrs/3yr |
| Annual Equivalent | 50 hrs/yr | 50 hrs/yr |
| Renewal Cycle | 4 years | 3 years |
| Category 1 Minimum | 60 hrs (Cat 1 required) | 60 hrs (Cat 1 required) |
| Suicide Training | 6 hrs one-time | 6 hrs one-time |
| Health Equity | 2 hrs/cycle | 2 hrs/cycle |
| Opioid Training | 1 hr one-time | 1 hr one-time |
| Board Cert Alternative | ABMS/ABOMS MOC | ABMS/ABOMS MOC |

**Key Difference:** Different renewal cycles (4-year vs 3-year) create synchronization complexity every 12 years.

- **Split-board with different cycles:** MD 4-year vs DO 3-year
- **Mandatory topics:** Suicide (6 hrs one-time), health equity (2 hrs/cycle), opioid (1 hr one-time)
- **Category flexibility:** Mix of Cat 1-5 with 80-hr limits per category
- **MOC alternative:** ABMS/ABOMS MOC provides full exemption

**For Physician Compliance:**
1. Track 200 hours over 4-year cycle
2. Include 60 hours Category 1 minimum
3. Complete suicide training (6 hrs one-time)
4. Complete health equity CME (2 hrs per cycle)
5. Complete opioid training if prescriber (1 hr one-time)
6. Consider ABMS/ABOMS MOC as alternative
7. Renew every 4 years through WA portal

**Annual Rate:** 50 hours/year (same as DO board despite different cycle lengths)
