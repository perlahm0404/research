## BOARD INFORMATION & AUTHORITY

### Board Structure

[FACT - STATUTE] The Alaska State Medical Board operates under AS 08.64 (Medical Practice Act) and is part of the Division of Corporations, Business and Professional Licensing (CBPL) within the Department of Commerce, Community, and Economic Development.

[FACT - BOARD] Board website: https://www.commerce.alaska.gov/web/cbpl/professionallicensing/statemedicalboard
[FACT - BOARD] Phone: (907) 271-2087
[FACT - BOARD] Email: dpl.med@alaska.gov

### CME Authority

[FACT - ADMIN_CODE] CME requirements are detailed in 12 AAC 40.200 through 12 AAC 40.240 (Administrative Code Chapter 40, sections 200-240).

[FACT - STATUTE] Per AS 08.64.087: Physicians must demonstrate compliance with CME requirements to renew their licenses.

---

## LIFECYCLE PHASES & GRACE PERIODS

### Biennial Renewal Cycle

[FACT - STATUTE] All Alaska physician licenses expire **December 31 of even-numbered years** (2024, 2026, 2028, etc.).

[FACT - STATUTE] The renewal cycle is **24 months**, with CME required during the preceding 24-month period from the previous renewal.

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] Current renewal cycle is January 1, 2025 - December 31, 2026 for licenses expiring December 31, 2026.

### Grace Period

[CRITICAL GAP] Grace period information is not documented in statute or board materials reviewed. Alaska may allow renewal after December 31 with penalties, but specific grace period length is not documented.

**Search Status:** Searched statute AS 08.64.087 and 12 AAC 40.200-.240; no grace period found. May be addressed in board rules or practice.

### New Licensee Provisions

[CRITICAL GAP] Exemptions or reduced requirements for newly licensed physicians are not documented in materials reviewed.

---

## CME REQUIREMENTS - TOTAL HOURS & CATEGORIES

### Required CME Hours

[FACT - STATUTE] Per 12 AAC 40.200: Physicians must complete an **average of 25 hours of Category I AMA- or AOA-or CPMR approved continuing education hours for each year of the licensing period**, which equates to **50 hours total per 2-year cycle**.

[FACT - ADMIN_CODE] All CME must be Category I AMA-approved, Category I or II AOA-approved, or equivalent CPMR (Continuing Professional Medical Education) programs.

### CME Category Specifications

[FACT - STATUTE] Acceptable CME includes:
- **AMA PRA Category 1 Credits™** (primary)
- **AOA Category 1 or 2 credits** (for osteopathic education)
- **CPMR equivalent programs**

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] Alaska accepts flexible categories (AMA Category 1, AOA 1 or 2, CPMR equivalent) with no restrictions on Category 2 usage (unlike some states).

---

## CME TOPIC REQUIREMENTS

### Mandatory Opioid Education (Conditional)

[FACT - STATUTE] Per 12 AAC 40.220: Physicians who hold a **valid DEA registration** must complete at least **2 hours of CME** specific to:
- Pain management and opioid use
- Opioid addiction and treatment

[FACT - STATUTE] This requirement must be met but is **waived if the physician does not hold a valid DEA registration**.

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] The 2-hour opioid education requirement counts toward the overall 50-hour total, not in addition to it.

### No Recurring Topic Mandates

[FACT - STATUTE] Alaska does not mandate specific recurring CME topics beyond the conditional 2-hour opioid requirement for DEA holders.

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] Physicians may select remaining CME hours freely from any AMA/AOA/CPMR-approved programs in their specialty areas.

---

## CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE CONTEXT

### DEA Registration and Opioid CME

[FACT - STATUTE] Per 12 AAC 40.220: The 2-hour opioid education requirement applies **only to physicians holding valid DEA registration** at the time of license renewal.

[FACT - STATUTE] If a physician does not hold DEA registration, this 2-hour requirement is waived entirely.

### Non-DEA Physicians

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] Physicians who do not prescribe, dispense, or handle controlled substances (no DEA) are not subject to the 2-hour opioid CME requirement.

---

## AUDIT & VERIFICATION PROCEDURES

### Self-Attestation at Renewal

[FACT - STATUTE] Per 12 AAC 40.220: "At the time of renewal, the licensee must attest to compliance with the CME requirements."

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] Initial verification is self-reporting/attestation rather than submission of documentation with renewal.

### Random Computer-Generated Audits

[FACT - STATUTE] "After renewal is completed, the division will perform a computer-generated random audit of licensees who will be required to provide proof of CME courses."

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] The board selects physicians randomly after renewal to provide documentation of CME completion. This is a post-renewal audit process.

### Proof Documentation Required

[CRITICAL GAP] Specific documentation requirements (e.g., certificates, transcripts) are not detailed in statute or board materials reviewed.

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] Standard documentation would include CME completion certificates from approved providers showing hours and category level.

### Penalties for Non-Compliance

[CRITICAL GAP] Specific penalties for audit failure or CME non-compliance are not detailed in statute or board materials reviewed. May be addressed in disciplinary rules outside the scope of CME regulations.

---

## EXEMPTIONS & ALTERNATIVES

### Retired Physician Exemption

[FACT - STATUTE] Per 12 AAC 40.210: "Individuals who are renewing their licenses in 'Retired' status are not required to complete continuing medical education."

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] Physicians licensed as "retired" are fully exempt from the 50-hour CME requirement. This likely requires formal registration of retired status with the board.

### Carryover Exemption Limitation

[FACT - STATUTE] Per tracker notes and FSMB data: "Physician may not be exempted more than 15 hours per 5-year period."

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] While Alaska allows some CME carryover or exemptions, physicians cannot accumulate exemptions totaling more than 15 hours in any 5-year rolling period. This limits the use of exemptions/waivers.

### Board Certification

[CRITICAL GAP] Whether ABMS/ABOS board certification provides exemption from or credit toward CME requirement is not explicitly documented in materials reviewed.

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] Some states provide board cert exemption; Alaska's stance unclear and may require board contact for clarification.

### Hardship and Medical Exemptions

[CRITICAL GAP] Hardship or medical exemptions are not documented in statute reviewed.

---

## RENEWAL FEES & TIMELINE

### Renewal Period and Deadline

[FACT - STATUTE] Per AS 08.64.087 and board documents: All licenses expire **December 31 of even-numbered years**.

[FACT - BOARD] Physicians must apply for renewal before the December 31 expiration date.

### Renewal Fee

[CRITICAL GAP] Specific renewal fee amounts are not documented in statute or publicly accessible board materials.

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] Fee schedules are typically posted on the Alaska licensing portal or available upon board contact.

### Late Renewal and Grace Period

[CRITICAL GAP] Late renewal fees and grace period details are not documented in materials reviewed.

---

## LAPSED LICENSE REINSTATEMENT

### Reinstatement Process

[CRITICAL GAP] Specific reinstatement procedures, including CME requirements, fees, and application process, are not documented in statute or board materials reviewed.

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] Physicians allowing licenses to lapse would likely need to submit a reinstatement application with CME documentation for the preceding renewal cycle.

---

## CME TRACKING SYSTEMS

### Self-Tracking Model

[FACT - STATUTE] Physicians are responsible for tracking and maintaining CME documentation.

[FACT - BOARD] The Alaska board does not appear to use mandatory provider reporting systems like CE Broker. Documentation is submitted upon request during audits.

### Accredited Providers

[FACT - STATUTE] Acceptable CME providers include:
- AMA-accredited providers (Category 1)
- AOA-accredited providers (Category 1 or 2)
- CPMR-equivalent programs

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] Physicians should ensure CME providers are officially accredited to avoid non-compliant credits.

---

## STATE-SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS

### Biennial December 31 Deadline

[FACT - STATUTE] Alaska uses a firm December 31 deadline for biennial renewal (even-numbered years). This differs from many states using birth month renewal dates or spring deadlines.

### 5-Year Exemption Cap

[FACT - STATUTE] Per tracker notes: "Physician may not be exempted more than 15 hours per 5-year period" indicates Alaska tracks cumulative exemptions across 5-year rolling periods, likely a unique provision.
