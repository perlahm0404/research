## CME Audits

- Failure to submit verification during an audit results in inability to practice
- **Warning:** Misrepresenting CME information is equivalent to a fraudulent application and could seriously jeopardize your license to practice

## Emeritus Status

Physicians may apply for **Emeritus (fully retired) status**, which:

- Permits use of the "MD" title
