## 1. Board Information & Regulatory Authority

### Official Board Information

[FACT - BOARD] The Wyoming Board of Medicine is the official regulatory agency for physicians in Wyoming. Website: https://health.wyo.gov/. Phone: (307) 778-7053. (Accessed 2026-01-02)

[FACT - STATUTE] The Wyoming Board of Medicine's authority derives from the Wyoming Medical Practice Act (Wyo. Stat. § 33-26-101 et seq.) and the Wyoming Department of Health regulatory framework.

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] Wyoming operates a unified medical board regulating both MD and DO physicians under the same statutory framework and CME requirements.

### Primary Statutory Framework

[FACT - STATUTE] Wyoming Statutes § 33-26-402 establishes the statutory requirement for license renewal and continuing education. Source: Wyo. Stat. § 33-26-402.

[FACT - ADMIN_CODE] Wyoming Board of Medicine Rules, Chapter 2, Section 11 provides the detailed regulatory framework for continuing medical education requirements, including the 60-hour triennial requirement, category flexibility, mandatory topics, and board certification recognition. Source: WY Board of Medicine Rules Ch. 2, § 11.

[FACT - BOARD] Renewal portal: https://wyomingbom.glsuite.us/ (Wyoming Board of Medicine online licensing)

---

## 2. Renewal Cycle & Dates

### Triennial Renewal Schedule (Every 3 Years)

[FACT - STATUTE] Wyoming physicians renew their medical licenses every 3 years (triennial cycle). WY Board of Medicine Rules Ch. 2, § 11.

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] The triennial (3-year) renewal cycle is **longer than most states** (which use biennial/2-year cycles), providing more time to accumulate CME hours but requiring a higher total (60 hours vs. 30-50 in biennial states).

[CRITICAL GAP] The specific renewal deadline dates (birth month, fixed date, license issuance anniversary, etc.) are not documented in the accessible materials reviewed. Physicians should verify their individual renewal date through the Wyoming Board of Medicine portal or by contacting the board directly.

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] Based on common state practices, Wyoming likely uses either a birth month renewal system or a license issuance anniversary system. Individual physicians should confirm their renewal date.

### Renewal Timeline & Submission Windows

[CRITICAL GAP] Renewal submission window timeline (e.g., 60 days prior to expiration, 90 days prior) is not documented in accessible materials. Contact Wyoming Board of Medicine at (307) 778-7053 for specific renewal window information.

[CRITICAL GAP] Grace period mechanics and late renewal procedures are not documented in accessible statute or administrative code materials reviewed.

## 3. CME Requirements - Base Hours & Categories

### Total CME Hours Required

[FACT - STATUTE] Wyoming requires **60 continuing medical education hours every 3 years (triennial renewal cycle)**. All 60 hours may be AMA Category 1 or Category 2 or AOA equivalent. WY Board of Medicine Rules Ch. 2, § 11.

[FACT - FSMB] FSMB State CME Requirements document confirms: "60 hrs/3yr, all Category 1 or 2. Controlled substance licensees: 1 hr responsible prescribing/substance use every 2 yrs. Board accepts AMA-approved Category 1/II, AOA-approved, current AMA PRA, or ABMS specialty board cert/recert." This matches the statutory requirement.

### Category Requirements (Category 1 or 2 Accepted)

[FACT - STATUTE] All 60 hours may be **AMA Category 1 or AMA Category 2 or AOA equivalent**. Wyoming accepts both formal accredited CME (Category 1) and informal CME (Category 2 such as self-study, journal reading, teaching). WY Board of Medicine Rules Ch. 2, § 11.

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] Wyoming's category flexibility is **more permissive than many states**. Physicians can complete all 60 hours from informal Category 2 activities if desired, or all from formal Category 1, or any mix.

**Comparison to Other States in This Research:**
- Nebraska: All 50 hours must be Category 1 (no Category 2)
- Utah: 34 hours minimum Category 1, max 6 DOPL-approved
- Virginia: 30 hours minimum Category 1, remaining 30 may be Category 2
- Wisconsin: All 30 hours must be Category 1 (no Category 2)
- **Wyoming: All 60 hours may be Category 1 or Category 2 (MOST FLEXIBLE)**

### Recognition of AMA PRA, AOA, and ABMS Certification

[FACT - STATUTE] The Wyoming Board of Medicine **accepts AMA-approved Category 1/II, AOA-approved, current AMA Physician's Recognition Award (PRA), or ABMS specialty board certification/recertification** as evidence of CME compliance. WY Board of Medicine Rules Ch. 2, § 11.

[FACT - FSMB] FSMB confirms: "Board accepts AMA-approved Category 1/II, AOA-approved, current AMA PRA, or ABMS specialty board cert/recert."

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] Physicians who maintain current AMA PRA, AOA certification, or ABMS board certification/recertification status may be able to satisfy the Wyoming CME requirement by providing proof of current certification, rather than submitting individual course certificates.

[CRITICAL GAP] Whether AMA PRA, AOA certification, or ABMS cert/recert provides a **complete exemption** from the 60-hour requirement or simply serves as **documentation** of compliance is not explicitly stated in accessible materials.

[CRITICAL GAP] Whether ABMS certification recognition requires active Maintenance of Certification (MOC) status or simply board certification is not documented.

## 4. CME Topic Requirements - Mandatory Topics

### Overview of Mandatory Topics

[FACT - STATUTE] Wyoming has one mandatory CME topic: **1 hour responsible prescribing/substance use every 2 years** for physicians with controlled substance licenses. WY Board of Medicine Rules Ch. 2, § 11.

[FACT - FSMB] FSMB confirms: "Controlled substance licensees: 1 hr responsible prescribing/substance use every 2 yrs."

### Topic 1: Responsible Prescribing/Substance Use (1 hour every 2 years, CONDITIONAL - Controlled Substance Licensees Only)

[FACT - STATUTE] Physicians who hold a **controlled substance license** must complete **1 hour of continuing education on responsible prescribing and substance use** every 2 years. This requirement applies only to physicians with controlled substance prescribing authority. WY Board of Medicine Rules Ch. 2, § 11.

[FACT - FSMB] FSMB confirms: "Controlled substance licensees: 1 hr responsible prescribing/substance use every 2 yrs."

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] The 1-hour responsible prescribing/substance use requirement is **conditional** based on controlled substance licensure. Physicians who do not hold controlled substance prescribing authority (e.g., some pathologists, radiologists, research physicians) are not subject to this requirement.

[CRITICAL - CYCLE COMPLEXITY] The mandatory topic operates on a **2-year cycle** while the overall renewal cycle is **3 years**, creating a **timing mismatch**:
- Overall renewal: Every 3 years (60 hours triennial)
- Responsible prescribing requirement: Every 2 years (for controlled substance licensees)

**Compliance Timing Example:**
- Year 0: License issued / renewed
- Year 2: 1 hour responsible prescribing due (first 2-year cycle)
- Year 3: License renewal (60 hours total CME due, including Year 2 responsible prescribing hour)
- Year 4: 1 hour responsible prescribing due (second 2-year cycle)
- Year 6: License renewal (60 hours total CME due, including Year 4 responsible prescribing hour)

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] The 1-hour requirement is integrated into the 60-hour triennial total (not in addition to the 60 hours). Controlled substance licensees complete 1 hour of responsible prescribing/substance use CME every 2 years, and this counts toward the 60-hour triennial requirement.

**Responsible Prescribing/Substance Use CME Content Areas (Likely):**
- Safe opioid prescribing practices
- Controlled substance risk assessment and screening
- Wyoming Prescription Drug Monitoring Program (PDMP) use and interpretation
- Recognition of substance use disorder and addiction
- Alternative pain management strategies
- CDC and state opioid prescribing guidelines
- Benzodiazepine prescribing and risks
- Responsible prescribing of stimulants and other controlled substances

[CRITICAL GAP] Specific acceptable courses, providers, or content standards for the 1-hour responsible prescribing/substance use requirement are not detailed in accessible materials. Physicians should verify acceptable courses with Wyoming Board of Medicine or review ACCME-accredited CME offerings.

[CRITICAL GAP] Whether "controlled substance licensees" refers to all physicians with DEA registration or a separate Wyoming-specific controlled substance license is not documented.

---

## 5. Exemptions & Alternatives

### Controlled Substance CME Exemption (Non-Licensees)

[FACT - STATUTE] The 1-hour responsible prescribing/substance use requirement applies only to **physicians with controlled substance licenses**. Physicians who do not hold controlled substance licenses are exempt from this requirement. WY Board of Medicine Rules Ch. 2, § 11.

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] Non-controlled-substance-licensed physicians complete only the general 60-hour triennial CME requirement, without the 1-hour mandatory topic.

### AMA Physician's Recognition Award (PRA)

[FACT - STATUTE] The Wyoming Board of Medicine accepts **current AMA Physician's Recognition Award (PRA)** as evidence of CME compliance. WY Board of Medicine Rules Ch. 2, § 11.

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] Physicians who maintain current AMA PRA status may satisfy the Wyoming CME requirement by submitting proof of current PRA certification.

[CRITICAL GAP] Whether AMA PRA provides a **complete exemption** from the 60-hour requirement or serves as **documentation** of compliance with the requirement is not explicitly stated.

### AOA Certification

[FACT - STATUTE] The Wyoming Board of Medicine accepts **AOA-approved** CME. WY Board of Medicine Rules Ch. 2, § 11.

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] Physicians may use AOA-approved CME (Category 1-A, 1-B, 2-A, 2-B) to satisfy the Wyoming 60-hour requirement.

### ABMS Board Certification/Recertification

[FACT - STATUTE] The Wyoming Board of Medicine accepts **ABMS specialty board certification or recertification** as evidence of CME compliance. WY Board of Medicine Rules Ch. 2, § 11.

[FACT - FSMB] FSMB confirms: "Board accepts... ABMS specialty board cert/recert."

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] Physicians who maintain ABMS board certification or complete ABMS recertification (including Maintenance of Certification/MOC activities) may satisfy the Wyoming CME requirement.

[CRITICAL GAP] Whether ABMS certification provides a **complete exemption** from the 60-hour requirement or whether MOC activities simply **count toward** the 60-hour requirement is not explicitly stated.

[CRITICAL GAP] Whether ABMS recognition requires active MOC status or simply current board certification is not documented.

### Newly Licensed Physicians

[CRITICAL GAP] Whether newly licensed physicians (first-time renewals) receive any exemption, reduction, or pro-rated CME requirement is not documented in accessible materials.

### Military Service & Hardship Exemptions

[CRITICAL GAP] Military service exemptions, hardship exemptions, or other special circumstances (illness, disability, etc.) are not documented in accessible materials.

---

## 6. Audit & Verification Procedures

### CME Documentation Requirements

[FACT - STATUTE] Physicians must maintain documentation of CME completion for audit and verification purposes. WY Board of Medicine Rules Ch. 2, § 11.

[CRITICAL GAP] The specific documentation retention period (e.g., 4 years, 6 years, duration of licensure) is not documented in accessible materials.

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] Physicians should retain CME certificates, transcripts, or other proof of completion for at least the duration of the current renewal cycle plus one additional cycle (approximately 6 years for triennial renewal) to ensure availability in case of audit.

### Audit Procedures

[FACT - STATUTE] The Wyoming Board of Medicine conducts random audits of physicians for CME compliance. WY Board of Medicine Rules Ch. 2, § 11.

[CRITICAL GAP] The percentage or frequency of audits (e.g., 5% of renewals annually, 10% of renewals) is not published in statute or accessible materials.

[CRITICAL GAP] Audit response timeline (e.g., 30 days to provide documentation, 60 days) is not documented.

[CRITICAL GAP] Consequences of audit non-compliance (fines, license suspension, additional CME requirements) are not detailed in accessible materials.

---

## 7. Renewal Procedures & Fees

### Standard Renewal Process

[FACT - BOARD] Physicians renew through the Wyoming Board of Medicine online portal at: https://wyomingbom.glsuite.us/

[CRITICAL GAP] Renewal submission window (when renewal opens prior to expiration) is not documented in accessible materials.

### Renewal Fees

[CRITICAL GAP] The specific renewal fee amount is not published in accessible materials reviewed. Physicians should check the renewal portal or contact Wyoming Board of Medicine at (307) 778-7053 for current fee information.

### Grace Period & Late Renewal

[CRITICAL GAP] Grace period mechanics (if any), late renewal procedures, and late fees are not documented in statute or accessible materials.

---

## 8. Lapsed License Reinstatement

### Reinstatement Procedures

[CRITICAL GAP] Lapsed license reinstatement procedures, timelines, and CME requirements for reinstatement are not documented in the materials reviewed.

[INFERENCE - LOW CONFIDENCE] Wyoming likely has tiered reinstatement procedures based on length of lapse (e.g., <1 year, 1-3 years, >3 years), similar to other TIER 1 states, but specific requirements are not documented.

---

## 9. Controlled Substance Context

### Responsible Prescribing/Substance Use CME (1 hour every 2 years, controlled substance licensees)

[FACT - STATUTE] As detailed in Section 4, physicians with controlled substance licenses must complete 1 hour of responsible prescribing/substance use education every 2 years. WY Board of Medicine Rules Ch. 2, § 11.

### Wyoming Prescription Drug Monitoring Program (PDMP)

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] The 1-hour responsible prescribing/substance use requirement likely includes training on the Wyoming Prescription Drug Monitoring Program (PDMP).

[CRITICAL GAP] Whether the 1-hour requirement includes a specific component on PDMP use is not documented.

---

## 10. CME Tracking Systems

### CME Tracking & Documentation

[CRITICAL GAP] Whether Wyoming uses a centralized CME tracking system (e.g., CE Broker) or relies on physician attestation and audit is not documented in accessible materials.

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] Based on common TIER 1 state practices, Wyoming likely uses a physician attestation system where physicians certify CME completion during renewal, with documentation verified only upon audit.

### CME Provider Auto-Reporting

[CRITICAL GAP] Whether CME providers are required to auto-report completion to the Wyoming Board of Medicine is not documented.

---

## Conclusion

Wyoming MD license renewal requirements are **straightforward and simple** (TIER 1) with a triennial CME requirement, category flexibility (Category 1 or 2 accepted), minimal mandatory topics, and recognition of board certification.

**Core Requirements Summary:**
- 60 hours triennial CME, all AMA Category 1 or Category 2 or AOA equivalent
- 1 hour responsible prescribing/substance use every 2 years (controlled substance licensees only)
- Recognition of AMA PRA, AOA-approved, and ABMS specialty board certification/recertification
- Triennial renewal cycle (every 3 years, longer than most states)
- Random audits conducted

**Key Simplicity Factors:**
1. Triennial renewal cycle (every 3 years) provides extended time to accumulate CME
2. Category flexibility (all 60 hours may be Category 1 or Category 2) - most flexible among surveyed states
3. Minimal mandatory topics (only 1 hour for controlled substance licensees)
4. Recognition of AMA PRA, AOA, and ABMS certification provides alternatives
5. Conditional controlled substance requirement (licensees only)

**Key Complexity Factor:**
1. **2-year vs. 3-year cycle timing mismatch** for controlled substance licensees (1-hour requirement every 2 years within a 3-year renewal cycle)

**For Physician Compliance:**
- **All physicians:** Complete 60 hours of CME every 3 years (may be Category 1 or Category 2 or AOA equivalent).
- **Controlled substance licensees:** Additionally complete 1 hour of responsible prescribing/substance use education every 2 years.
- **Non-controlled-substance-licensed physicians:** Complete only the general 60-hour triennial requirement.
- **Physicians with AMA PRA, AOA certification, or ABMS certification:** Verify whether certification satisfies the requirement (scope unclear, contact board for clarification).

**For Rules Engine Implementation:** The primary implementation challenges are clarifying the scope of AMA PRA, AOA, and ABMS certification recognition (exemption vs. documentation), tracking the 2-year mandatory topic cycle within the 3-year renewal cycle for controlled substance licensees, defining "controlled substance licensee," and obtaining renewal date mechanics and fee information from the board for complete implementation.
