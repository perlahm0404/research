# CME Audit Procedures Resolution - 18 States
## Gap Resolution Research Project

**Research Date:** January 3, 2026
**Researcher:** Claude Code (Sonnet 4.5)
**Project Scope:** Resolve CME audit procedure gaps for 18 states identified in comprehensive audit
**Estimated Effort:** 18-20 hours systematic research
**Status:** INITIAL ASSESSMENT COMPLETE - FULL RESEARCH REQUIRED

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The comprehensive audit of January 3, 2026 identified **18 states with unclear or undocumented CME audit procedures** representing approximately 30% of the research corpus. This document tracks the systematic resolution of audit procedure gaps through targeted research of state statutes, administrative codes, board websites, and direct board contact.

**Target Information for Each State:**
- Audit type (random, for-cause, universal, or both)
- Audit frequency/percentage (e.g., "5% of renewals annually")
- Audit trigger point (post-renewal, during renewal, board discretion)
- Response timeline (days to submit documentation)
- Required documentation (certificates, transcripts, affidavits)
- Penalties for non-compliance (fines, suspension, license action)
- Record retention requirements (years to maintain certificates)
- Evidence citations (statute sections, admin code, board URLs)

**Quality Standard:**
- Minimum 2 sources per state (statute + board website preferred)
- Exact citations with URLs
- Direct quotes of relevant regulatory language
- Mark as [CRITICAL GAP] if not found after 3+ search attempts

## BOARD CONTACT TEMPLATE

**Email Template for CME Audit Policy Requests:**

```
Subject: Request for CME Audit Policy Information - [State] Physicians

Dear [Board Name],

I am conducting research on continuing medical education (CME) requirements for physician license renewal and would greatly appreciate clarification on your CME audit procedures.

Could you please provide the following information:

1. What percentage (or number) of physician renewals are audited annually for CME compliance?
2. Are audits random, for-cause, or both?
3. How many days do physicians have to respond to an audit request with documentation?
4. What specific documentation is required during an audit (certificates, transcripts, affidavits)?
5. How long must physicians retain CME certificates for potential audit?
6. What are the penalties for failure to provide adequate documentation during an audit?

If this information is available in published regulations or board policies, please direct me to the appropriate source.

Thank you for your assistance with this research.

Sincerely,
[Researcher Name]
```
