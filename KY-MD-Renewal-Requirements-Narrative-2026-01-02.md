## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Kentucky requires physicians to complete 60 hours of CME per 3-year (triennial) renewal cycle with 30 hours minimum Category 1. The state is notable for **controlled substance prescriber requirements** (4.5 hours KASPER/pain management/addiction) and **primary care physician one-time requirements** (3 hours prescribing). Kentucky enforces a 31-day grace period (March 1 - April 1) with $50 late fee and clear escalating penalties for non-compliance: $200 fine + 6 months to comply, then suspension if still non-compliant.

**Key Highlights:**
- **CME Requirement:** 60 hours per 3-year cycle (30 hours Category 1 minimum)
- **Controlled Substance Requirement:** 4.5 hours for all prescribers (included in 60 hours)
- **Primary Care One-Time:** 3 hours prescribing education (within first 3 years of licensure)
- **Renewal Cycle:** Triennial (expires Feb 28; renew by Mar 1)
- **Grace Period:** Mar 1 - Apr 1 with $50 late fee
- **Penalties:** Clear escalation structure

## KEY DISTINCTIONS & FEATURES

**Kentucky-Specific Characteristics:**

1. **Clear Penalty Escalation:** Kentucky's progression ($50 late fee → $200 + 6 months → suspension) is transparent and well-documented.

2. **Controlled Substance Focus:** 4.5-hour requirement for all prescribers (not just DEA or pain specialists).

3. **Primary Care One-Time Requirement:** Only primary care physicians have additional requirement, reflecting focus on foundational prescribing knowledge.

4. **Triennial Cycle:** Longer 3-year cycle allows flexibility compared to annual/biennial states.
