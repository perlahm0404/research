            ## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

            Oklahoma's medical licensing renewal system for MDs is governed primarily by Title 59 of the Oklahoma Statutes (O.S. § 480-518.1) and Title 435 of the Oklahoma Administrative Code (OAC). Key findings include:

            - **CME Requirement:** 60 Category 1 hours within every 3-year renewal cycle
            - - **Grace Period:** 3 years from initial licensure or reinstatement before CME reporting begins
              - - **Renewal Cycle:** Triennial (3 years)
                - - **Online Renewal:** Available at https://pay.apps.ok.gov/medlic/md/
                  - - **Renewal Notice:** Mailed ~60 days before expiration
                    - - **Primary Authority:** Oklahoma State Board of Medical Licensure and Supervision (OBMLS)
                     
                      - **FSMB Discrepancies Identified:**
                      - - Grace period not mentioned in FSMB comparison documents
                        - - Specific CME hour requirements need verification against current FSMB data
