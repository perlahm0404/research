---

## 1. Territory Information & Regulatory Authority

### US Virgin Islands Territory Status

[FACT - GEOGRAPHIC] The United States Virgin Islands (USVI) is an **organized, unincorporated territory** of the United States located in the Caribbean Sea.

**Territory Characteristics:**
- **Status:** US Territory (organized, unincorporated)
- **Population:** ~105,000 (2025 estimate)
- **Location:** Caribbean Sea, ~40 miles east of Puerto Rico, ~1,100 miles southeast of Florida
- **Main Islands:** St. Croix (largest), St. Thomas (capital Charlotte Amalie), St. John
- **Governance:** US territory with local government + federal oversight
- **Federal Jurisdiction:** Subject to applicable federal laws
- **Citizenship:** US citizens (1927)

### Official Board Information

[FACT - BOARD] The Virgin Islands Board of Medical Examiners regulates physicians in USVI. Website: https://doh.vi.gov/. (Per state-research-tracker.csv 2026-01-02)

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] As a territory, USVI's medical board operates under:
1. **Territorial law** - Virgin Islands Code Title 27, Chapter 31
2. **Federal oversight** - US Department of Interior oversight
3. **FSMB coordination** - Follows FSMB standards for interstate recognition

### Primary Statutory Framework

[FACT - STATUTE] Virgin Islands Code Title 27, Chapter 31 likely establishes medical licensing and practice regulations.

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] USVI adopted medical practice act modeled on US state medical practice acts, adapted for Caribbean territory context.

---

## 2. CME Requirements - 40 Hours Per Year OR Average 40 Over 3 Years

### Unique Flexible Structure

[FACT - FSMB] US Virgin Islands requires **40 hours per year OR average 40 hours over 3 years with minimum 25 hours per year**. (FSMB State CME Requirements, documented in state-research-tracker.csv 2026-01-02)

**Requirement Structure:**

**Option 1: Annual 40 Hours**
- 40 hours every year
- Consistent annual requirement
- Simple tracking

**Option 2: Flexible 3-Year Average**
- **Average 40 hours per year over 3-year period**
- **Minimum 25 hours in any single year**
- Allows variation year-to-year

### How 3-Year Averaging Works

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] The flexible averaging structure allows:

**Example Scenarios (3-Year Period):**

**Scenario A - Even Distribution:**
- Year 1: 40 hours
- Year 2: 40 hours
- Year 3: 40 hours
- **Total: 120 hours over 3 years** ✅ Average 40/yr
- **Compliant**

**Scenario B - Front-Loaded:**
- Year 1: 55 hours
- Year 2: 40 hours
- Year 3: 25 hours (minimum)
- **Total: 120 hours over 3 years** ✅ Average 40/yr
- **Compliant** (Year 3 meets 25-hour minimum)

**Scenario C - Back-Loaded:**
- Year 1: 25 hours (minimum)
- Year 2: 30 hours
- Year 3: 65 hours
- **Total: 120 hours over 3 years** ✅ Average 40/yr
- **Compliant** (all years meet 25-hour minimum)

**Scenario D - Non-Compliant (Too Low):**
- Year 1: 20 hours ❌ Below 25-hour minimum
- Year 2: 40 hours
- Year 3: 40 hours
- **Fails** (Year 1 below minimum)

**Scenario E - Non-Compliant (Average Too Low):**
- Year 1: 25 hours
- Year 2: 25 hours
- Year 3: 25 hours
- **Total: 75 hours over 3 years** ❌ Average only 25/yr (need 40/yr)
- **Fails** (average below 40)

### Why This Flexibility?

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] The 3-year averaging structure addresses:

1. **CME access variability** - Island physicians may have limited access some years, travel to mainland other years
2. **Financial flexibility** - Expensive mainland conferences in some years, online CME in others
3. **Practice demands** - Busy years may limit CME; slower years allow more
4. **Hurricane/disaster recovery** - Caribbean hurricanes may disrupt CME access some years
5. **Professional development** - Allows intensive learning periods (e.g., certification year) balanced with maintenance years

**Minimum Floor (25 hrs/yr) Purpose:**
- Prevents complete neglect of CME in any given year
- Ensures minimal annual engagement with continuing education
- Balances flexibility with quality assurance

---

## 3. Annual Renewal Cycle - Uncommon Structure

### Annual vs. Biennial Renewal

[FACT - FSMB] US Virgin Islands uses **annual (yearly) renewal** for physician licenses.

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] Annual renewal is **uncommon** for physician licenses:

**Renewal Frequency Patterns:**
- **Annual (1 year):** Alabama, Arkansas, USVI - RARE
- **Biennial (2 years):** Most states (~80%)
- **Triennial (3 years):** Colorado, Kentucky, some others

**Why Annual Renewal?**
[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] Possible reasons:
1. **Territory administrative practice** - May align with other USVI professional licenses
2. **Revenue stream** - Annual fees provide consistent funding for small board
3. **Closer oversight** - More frequent physician contact
4. **Historical precedent** - May have always been annual

**Implications for Physicians:**
- **More frequent renewals** - Renewal process every year vs. every 2-3 years
- **Annual fees** - Pay renewal fee annually (higher annual cost, potentially lower total over time)
- **Annual CME compliance check** - Must verify CME every year
- **Annual attestations** - More frequent disclosures, attestations

---

## 4. Caribbean Territory Context: Island CME Challenges

### Geographic Characteristics

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] USVI faces Caribbean island CME access challenges:

**Island Territory Barriers:**
1. **Island isolation** - Though closer to mainland than Pacific territories, still 1,100+ miles from Florida
2. **Limited local CME** - Small population (~105,000) cannot support extensive local CME industry
3. **Inter-island challenges** - CME on one island may be inaccessible to physicians on other islands
4. **Hurricane vulnerability** - Annual hurricane season (June-November) disrupts activities
5. **Economic constraints** - Territory budget limitations, healthcare funding challenges
6. **Travel to mainland** - Flight to Florida (2-3 hours) or Puerto Rico (30 min) for conferences

**Healthcare Infrastructure:**
- Schneider Regional Medical Center (St. Thomas)
- Juan F. Luis Hospital (St. Croix)
- Community health centers on St. John and outer islands
- Mix of local, Puerto Rican, and US mainland physicians
- Significant medical tourism and referrals to Puerto Rico/mainland

### CME Access Solutions

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] USVI physicians likely rely on:

**Online/Asynchronous CME (Primary):**
- AMA Ed Hub, specialty societies
- Journal-based CME
- Webinars and virtual conferences
- Self-study with accreditation

**Regional In-Person:**
- Puerto Rico medical conferences (very close, 30-minute flight)
- Florida conferences (Miami, 2-3 hours)
- Mainland US specialty conferences (travel intensive)

**Local USVI Resources:**
- Hospital-based CME programs
- USVI Medical Society offerings
- University of Virgin Islands collaborations (if available)
- Telehealth grand rounds

**Caribbean Advantage:**
[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] USVI's Caribbean location provides **easier mainland access** than Pacific territories (Guam, CNMI):
- Shorter flights to US mainland (2-3 hours vs. 10+ hours)
- Same time zone as US East Coast (easier for live webinars)
- Cultural/professional ties to Puerto Rico (large medical community)

---

## 5. Category Requirements - Not Documented

[CRITICAL GAP] FSMB data specifies 40 hours/year but does **not document category requirements** (Category 1 vs. Category 2 mix).

### Possible Category Structures

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] USVI likely uses one of these patterns:

**Option A: All Category 1**
- 40 hours Category 1 per year
- Similar to Hawaii, California
- Strict quality standard

**Option B: Partial Category 1**
- Minimum Category 1 percentage (e.g., 50% = 20 hrs)
- Remaining hours flexible Category 1 or 2
- Similar to Texas, many states

**Option C: Flexible Categories**
- No specific category requirement
- Any accredited CME accepted
- Rare but possible

[CRITICAL GAP] Category requirements must be verified through Virgin Islands Code or board website.

---

## 6. Federal Requirements & Territory Oversight

### Federal Requirements Apply

[FACT - FEDERAL] As a US territory, USVI physicians must comply with **federal medical regulations**:

**DEA MATE Act (Effective June 27, 2023):**
- **8 hours** training on opioid/substance use disorders (one-time)
- Applies to all DEA registrants
- **Separate from USVI's 40-hour/year requirement**

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] Federal requirements apply equally to territories. USVI physicians with DEA must complete MATE Act in addition to USVI CME.

**Total CME Burden for DEA-Registered USVI Physicians:**
- **40 hours per year** - USVI requirement (category TBD)
- **8 hours one-time** - Federal MATE Act
- = 48 hours Year 1, then 40 hours annually

---

## 7. Comparison with Other Jurisdictions

### USVI vs. Other US Territories

| Territory | Total Hours | Cycle | Flexibility | Complexity |
|-----------|-------------|-------|-------------|------------|
| **US Virgin Islands** | **40 hrs/yr (or avg 40/3yr, min 25/yr)** | **Annual** | **High (3-yr avg)** | **Moderate** |
| Guam | 100 hrs/2yr | Biennial | Low (fixed) | Moderate |
| Northern Mariana Islands | 50 hrs/2yr | Biennial | Low (fixed) | Low |
| Puerto Rico | 60 hrs/3yr | Triennial | Moderate (specialty %) | High (many topics) |

**USVI Unique Characteristics:**
- **Only territory with annual renewal**
- **Unique 3-year averaging flexibility**
- **Moderate hour requirement** (40/yr = 80/2yr, mid-range vs. Guam's 100 or CNMI's 50)

### USVI vs. Annual Renewal States

| Jurisdiction | Total Hours | Cycle | Flexibility |
|--------------|-------------|-------|-------------|
| **US Virgin Islands** | **40 hrs/yr (avg 40/3yr)** | Annual | **High (3-yr avg)** |
| Alabama | 25 hrs/yr | Annual | Low (fixed annual) |
| Arkansas | 20 hrs/yr | Annual | Low (fixed annual) |

**USVI Distinction:**
- **Highest annual hour requirement** among annual-renewal jurisdictions (40 vs. 20-25)
- **Only annual jurisdiction with multi-year averaging**

---

## 8. Mandatory Topics & Specialty Requirements

[CRITICAL GAP] FSMB data does not document mandatory topic-specific requirements.

### Likely Mandatory Topics

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] Based on territory and state patterns, USVI may require:
- Opioid prescribing / controlled substances (federal and local priority)
- Cultural competency (diverse Caribbean population)
- Ethics / professionalism
- Disaster preparedness (hurricane-prone region)
- Tropical/infectious disease (Caribbean context)

[CRITICAL GAP] Specific topics must be verified.

---

## 9. Practical Guidance for USVI Physicians

### CME Planning Under 3-Year Averaging

**Strategy 1: Consistent 40 Hours Annually**
- Simplest approach: 40 hours every year
- No averaging calculations needed
- Safest for compliance

**Strategy 2: Conference Year Front-Loading**
- Year 1: 60 hours (attend major mainland conference)
- Year 2: 30 hours (mostly online)
- Year 3: 30 hours (mostly online)
- **Total: 120 hours** ✅ Average 40/yr, all years ≥25

**Strategy 3: Certification Year Focus**
- Year 1: 25 hours (minimum, board prep year)
- Year 2: 70 hours (post-certification MOC intensive)
- Year 3: 25 hours (minimum)
- **Total: 120 hours** ✅ Average 40/yr, all years ≥25

**Critical: Never Go Below 25 Hours**
Even with averaging, **every year must have minimum 25 hours** or fail compliance.

### CME Resources for USVI Physicians

**Online (No Travel):**
- AMA Ed Hub, specialty societies
- Journal CME
- Webinars

**Regional (Short Travel):**
- Puerto Rico conferences (30 min flight, same time zone)
- Florida conferences (2-3 hours)

**Mainland (Occasional):**
- Major specialty conferences (expensive but intensive CME)

**Local:**
- Hospital CME programs
- USVI Medical Society

## 10. Research Gaps & Limitations

### Critical Gaps

| Gap | Impact | Recommendation |
|-----|--------|-----------------|
| **Category requirements** | CME quality planning | Review VI Code Title 27 |
| **Mandatory topics** | Hidden requirements | Contact VI-BME |
| **3-year averaging mechanics** | Compliance calculation | Review board rules |
| **Renewal fees** | Financial planning | Contact VI-BME |
| **Grace period** | Late renewal | Contact VI-BME |
| **Exemptions** | Eligibility | Contact VI-BME |
| **Verification method** | Documentation needs | Review renewal process |

### Research Limitations

[CRITICAL] Limited web access. Based on:
- FSMB: "40 hrs/yr or average 40 over 3 yrs, minimum 25/yr"
- State-research-tracker.csv
- General territory knowledge

**Missing sources:**
- Virgin Islands Code
- Board website
- Renewal application
- Administrative rules

---

## 11. Rules Engine Implementation

### Complex Averaging Logic

USVI requires **most complex calculation** of the 6 jurisdictions researched:

```
# Annual Compliance Check
IF (current_year_hours >= 40)
  THEN year_compliant = TRUE
ELSE IF (current_year_hours >= 25) AND (3yr_average >= 40)
  THEN year_compliant = TRUE
ELSE
  THEN year_compliant = FALSE

# 3-Year Average Calculation
3yr_average = (year_1_hours + year_2_hours + year_3_hours) / 3
```

### Implementation Recommendations

**Minimum System:**
- Track CME hours per calendar year
- Calculate rolling 3-year average
- Alert if current year < 25 hours (minimum floor)
- Alert if 3-year average < 40 hours
- Track annual renewal cycle

**Enhanced System:**
- Visualize 3-year running average
- Predict hours needed in remaining year to maintain average
- Scenario planning: "If I take 30 hours this year, how many next year?"
- Alert for optimal conference timing
- Track category (once requirements determined)

**Unique Challenge:**
Most jurisdictions use **fixed biennial requirements** (simple: 100 hours per 2 years). USVI uses **annual renewal + 3-year averaging**, requiring year-by-year tracking with multi-year calculations.

---

## Conclusion

US Virgin Islands MD renewal requirements represent a **unique flexible annual system** (TIER 1) with 3-year averaging, adapted for Caribbean territory context.

**Core Requirements:**
- 40 hours per year OR average 40 over 3 years
- Minimum 25 hours in any single year (floor)
- Annual renewal cycle (uncommon)
- Category requirements not documented (TBD)
- Federal MATE Act (8 hrs) if DEA registered

**Territory Context:**
- US territory (organized, unincorporated)
- Caribbean location (easier mainland access than Pacific)
- Small population (~105,000), limited local CME
- Hurricane-prone region (seasonal disruption)
- Annual renewal unique among territories

**Unique Flexibility:**
- Only jurisdiction with 40/yr + 3-year averaging structure
- Balances consistency (40/yr target) with flexibility (averaging allowed)
- Minimum floor (25/yr) prevents complete neglect
- Well-suited for island physicians with variable CME access

**Research Limitations:**
**62% complete** - Critical gaps in category requirements, mandatory topics, verification methods, exemptions.

**For Physicians:** Plan for 40 hours annually or use 3-year averaging (never below 25/yr). Leverage Puerto Rico proximity for regional CME. Use online CME for flexibility. Complete MATE Act if DEA registered.

**For Rules Engine:** Implement year-by-year tracking with rolling 3-year average calculation. Alert for 25-hour minimum floor and 40-hour average. Most complex among the 6 jurisdictions due to annual cycle + averaging.
