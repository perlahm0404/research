## 1. Board Information & Regulatory Authority

### Official Board Information

[FACT - BOARD] The Rhode Island Board of Medical Licensure and Discipline is the official regulatory agency for physicians in Rhode Island. Website: https://health.ri.gov/licenses/detail.php?id=230. Phone: (401) 222-3855. (Standard research date: 2026-01-02)

[FACT - STATUTE] The Rhode Island Board of Medical Licensure and Discipline's authority derives from Rhode Island General Laws § 5-37-1 et seq., which establishes the board's powers and duties related to licensing and regulation of physicians.

### Primary Statutory Framework

[FACT - STATUTE] Rhode Island General Laws § 5-37-5.1 is the primary statute governing continuing medical education requirements for physicians. This section establishes the 40-hour CME requirement per biennial cycle.

[FACT - ADMIN_CODE] 216-RICR-40-05-9 provides detailed requirements for continuing medical education, including category requirements and mandatory topics.

[FACT - BOARD] Renewal information and portal: https://health.ri.gov/licenses/detail.php?id=230

### Unified Board Structure

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] Rhode Island operates a unified board for MD and DO physicians under a single board authority, though CME requirements may have subtle differences in category acceptance (AOA categories for DO physicians). This research document covers MD-specific requirements.

---

## 2. Renewal Cycle & Dates

### Biennial Renewal Schedule

[FACT - STATUTE] Rhode Island physicians renew their medical licenses every 24 months (biennial renewal cycle). RIGL § 5-37-10.

[CRITICAL GAP] The specific renewal coordination mechanism (e.g., individual dates, birth month, registration date, or statewide fixed dates) is not detailed in readily accessible materials. This should be clarified with the board.

### Renewal Timeline & Submission Windows

[FACT - BOARD] Physicians may renew through the Rhode Island Department of Health licensing portal.

[CRITICAL GAP] Specific renewal submission windows (e.g., 60-90 days before expiration) and grace period information are not documented in readily accessible board materials. This should be clarified with the board.

---

## 3. CME Requirements - Base Hours & Categories

### Total CME Hours Required

[FACT - STATUTE] Rhode Island requires **40 continuing medical education hours every 2 years (biennial cycle)**. RIGL § 5-37-5.1.

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] At 40 hours biennial, Rhode Island aligns with common moderate CME requirements among states (similar to Arizona, Delaware, Hawaii, Idaho, Mississippi, South Carolina, and others).

### Category Requirements - All Category 1 or AOA 1A

[FACT - STATUTE] All 40 hours must be **AMA PRA Category 1 Credit** or **AOA Category 1A Credit**. RIGL § 5-37-5.1 and 216-RICR-40-05-9.

[FACT - STATUTE] Rhode Island does **NOT accept AMA PRA Category 2 Credit** or other informal self-study activities for CME compliance.

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] Rhode Island's all-Category-1/1A requirement is restrictive compared to states that allow mixed Category 1/Category 2 credits (like Texas or New Hampshire). This ensures all CME is formal, accredited education.

### CME Categories & Formats

[FACT - STATUTE] Acceptable CME must be:
- **AMA PRA Category 1 Credit** from ACCME-accredited providers
- **AOA Category 1A Credit** (live programs, formal accredited education for DO physicians)
- Live conferences, online courses with evaluation, enduring materials with post-testing
- State medical association-approved programs
- Specialty society programs with AMA Category 1 or AOA 1A designation

(216-RICR-40-05-9)

### Carryover of Excess CME Hours

[CRITICAL GAP] Research did not identify explicit carryover provisions in accessible statute or board materials. Whether excess CME hours can be carried forward to the next renewal period is unclear and should be verified with the board.

---

## 4. CME Topic Requirements - Mandatory Topics

### Overview of Mandatory Topics - Flexible 2-Hour Requirement

[FACT - STATUTE] Rhode Island has a unique **flexible mandatory topic requirement**. Physicians must complete **2 hours of continuing education** in **one or more** of the following topics:

- Universal precautions
- Infection control
- Modes of transmission (infectious diseases)
- Bioterrorism preparedness
- End-of-life care
- Palliative care
- OSHA standards
- Ethics
- Pain management

(RIGL § 5-37-5.1 and 216-RICR-40-05-9)

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] This flexible approach allows physicians to select topics relevant to their practice rather than mandating specific topics for all physicians. Physicians can satisfy this requirement with:
- 2 hours in a single topic (e.g., 2 hrs pain management)
- 1 hour each in two topics (e.g., 1 hr ethics + 1 hr infection control)
- Any combination totaling 2 hours from the list

[CRITICAL GAP] The statute does not clarify:
- Whether the 2 hours must be Category 1 or can include other formats (though all 40 hours must be Category 1, so this is likely implied)
- Whether specific course content standards apply for each topic
- Whether courses covering multiple topics (e.g., ethics and pain management) can count toward both categories

These details should be verified with the board.

### Comparison to Other States

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] Rhode Island's flexible topic list is more permissive than states with strict mandatory topics:
- **More flexible than:** Texas (specific pain mgmt + ethics), Ohio (specific duty to report), Oregon (specific pain mgmt structure)
- **Similar flexibility to:** States with "choose from list" approaches

This flexibility reduces compliance burden while still ensuring physicians address important practice areas.

### Other Mandatory Topics - None Beyond Flexible Requirement

[FACT - RESEARCH] Research identified no other state-wide mandatory CME topics beyond the flexible 2-hour requirement. Rhode Island does not appear to have additional general mandatory requirements for specific topics outside the choice list.

---

## 5. Exemptions & Special Circumstances

### Board Certification/MOC Equivalency (ABMS)

[FACT - STATUTE] Physicians participating in an **ABMS Maintenance of Certification (MOC) program** are considered to have met the CME requirement. RIGL § 5-37-5.1.

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] This equivalency suggests that active participation in ABMS MOC programs (which include ongoing CME, self-assessment, and quality improvement activities) satisfies the entire 40-hour biennial CME requirement.

[CRITICAL GAP] The statute does not clarify:
- Whether MOC participation alone is sufficient or if recertification/exam is required
- How the timing aligns (MOC during the biennium vs at renewal)
- Whether the 2-hour flexible topic requirement is also exempted or must still be completed
- What documentation is required to prove MOC participation status
- Whether AOA-BOS MOC provides equivalent exemption for DO physicians

These details should be verified with the board.

### First-Time Renewal Provisions

[CRITICAL GAP] Research did not identify explicit first-time renewal exemptions or reduced requirements for newly licensed physicians in accessible statute or board materials. Whether newly licensed physicians have grace periods or reduced CME requirements for their first renewal should be verified with the board.

### Retired or Inactive Physicians

[CRITICAL GAP] Exemptions for retired or inactive physician status are not documented in readily accessible materials. Physicians seeking retired status should contact the board directly.

---

## 6. CME Tracking & Compliance Verification

### CME Documentation Requirements

[FACT - STATUTE] Physicians must maintain documentation of CME completion and provide certificates upon request for audit or verification. 216-RICR-40-05-9.

[CRITICAL GAP] Specific documentation retention requirements (e.g., 2 years, 4 years, 6 years) are not detailed in readily accessible statute or board materials.

### Verification at Renewal

[FACT - BOARD] Physicians attest to CME compliance at renewal through the Rhode Island Department of Health licensing portal.

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] Rhode Island likely uses an attestation-based system at renewal with potential post-renewal audits, rather than requiring certificate upload at the time of renewal.

### Audit Procedures

[FACT - STATUTE] The Rhode Island Board of Medical Licensure and Discipline may audit CME compliance and request documentation. 216-RICR-40-05-9.

[CRITICAL GAP] The percentage or frequency of audits, whether audits are random or for-cause, and specific audit triggers are not published in readily accessible statute or board materials.

---

## 7. Renewal Procedures & Fees

### Standard Renewal Process

[FACT - BOARD] Physicians renew through the Rhode Island Department of Health licensing portal at https://health.ri.gov/licenses/detail.php?id=230

[CRITICAL GAP] Renewal submission windows (e.g., 60-90 days before expiration) are not specified in accessible materials.

### Renewal Fees

[CRITICAL GAP] The specific renewal fee amount is not published in readily accessible statute or board materials reviewed. This should be obtained from the board directly or through the renewal portal.

### Grace Period & Late Renewal

[CRITICAL GAP] Grace period mechanics and late fees are not documented in readily accessible statute or board materials. This should be clarified with the board.

## Conclusion

Rhode Island MD license renewal requirements are **straightforward** (TIER 1) with a moderate hour requirement (40 hours biennial) and unique flexible mandatory topic approach (2 hours from choice list).

**Core Requirements Summary:**
- 40 hours biennial CME, all hours must be AMA PRA Category 1 or AOA Category 1A (no Category 2)
- Mandatory flexible topic: 2 hours from list (universal precautions, infection control, modes of transmission, bioterrorism, end-of-life, palliative care, OSHA, ethics, pain management)
- Board certification/MOC equivalency: ABMS MOC program participation equivalent to meeting CME requirement (scope unclear)
- Renewal: Biennial (specific cycle dates not specified in accessible materials)
- No documented carryover policy

**For Physician Compliance:** Complete 40 hours AMA Category 1 (or AOA 1A) CME biennial, ensure 2 hours from the flexible topic list is included (physician choice which topics). Physicians participating in ABMS MOC programs should verify equivalency scope with board (whether 2-hour topic is exempted). Maintain CME documentation for potential audit.

**For Rules Engine Implementation:** The main implementation challenges are the flexible topic selection (2 hours from 9 choices - requires tracking physician selection), board cert/MOC equivalency scope (exemption details unclear), and renewal cycle coordination (specific dates needed). The 40-hour all-Category-1 requirement is straightforward to implement once procedural gaps are resolved.
