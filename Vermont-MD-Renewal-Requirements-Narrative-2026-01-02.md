## 1. Board Information & Regulatory Authority

### Official Board Information

[FACT - BOARD] The Vermont Board of Medical Practice is the official regulatory agency for allopathic physicians in Vermont. Website: https://mpb.health.vermont.gov. Phone: (802) 657-4223. Department of Health Board Page: https://www.healthvermont.gov/systems/board-medical-practice. (Accessed 2026-01-02)

[FACT - STATUTE] The board is a 17-member board composed of 9 physicians, 1 PA, 1 podiatrist, and 6 public members. 26 V.S.A. § 1351.

### Primary Statutory Framework

[FACT - STATUTE] Vermont Statutes Annotated § 1400 is the primary statute governing continuing medical education requirements and license renewal. Full citation: 26 V.S.A. § 1400 (Renewal of License; Continuing Medical Education). Source: https://law.justia.com/codes/vermont/

[FACT - ADMIN_CODE] Code Vermont Rules 13-141-001-X provides detailed implementation requirements for medical practice and CME compliance. Citation: Code Vt. R. 13-141-001-X (Rules of the Board of Medical Practice).

### Split-Board State Identification

[FACT - STATUTE] Vermont maintains separate regulatory structures for MD and DO physicians:
- **Vermont Board of Medical Practice** (26 V.S.A. § 1351 et seq.) regulates allopathic physicians
- **Vermont Board of Osteopathic Physicians and Surgeons** (separate board under Secretary of State) regulates osteopathic physicians

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] This is a SPLIT-BOARD STATE. Vermont maintains completely separate boards under different agencies (Board of Medical Practice under Department of Health; Osteopathic Board under Secretary of State). This creates fundamentally different regulatory structures, renewal dates, fees, and CME requirements.

---

## 2. Lifecycle Phases & Grace Periods

### Standard Renewal Timeline

[FACT - STATUTE] Vermont medical licenses are renewed on a biennial (2-year) cycle. Licenses expire on a fixed date: **November 30 of even-numbered years**. 26 V.S.A. § 1400(a).

[FACT - STATUTE] The renewal cycle period is December 1 - November 30 of each two-year licensing period. 26 V.S.A. § 1400(a).

[FACT - BOARD] The board provides 90-day advance notice before license expiration to allow time for renewal preparation. (https://www.healthvermont.gov/systems/board-medical-practice, accessed 2026-01-02)

### NO Grace Period

[FACT - STATUTE] Vermont provides **NO grace period** for license renewal. If a license is not renewed on or before the expiration date (November 30), it lapses immediately. 26 V.S.A. § 1400(a).

[FACT - STATUTE] Physicians cannot legally practice medicine in Vermont with a lapsed license. Continued practice after expiration constitutes unprofessional conduct subject to disciplinary action. 26 V.S.A. § 1400(a).

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] Vermont's no-grace-period policy is more stringent than most other states. Physicians must submit renewal applications and payment before November 30 or face immediate loss of licensure authority.

### License Expiration & Status Change

[FACT - STATUTE] Upon expiration (November 30), the license status changes from "active" to "lapsed." The physician must cease active medical practice in Vermont immediately. 26 V.S.A. § 1400(a).

---

## 3. CME Requirements - Total Hours & Categories

### Total CME Hours Required

[FACT - STATUTE] Vermont requires 30 credit hours of continuing medical education per biennial renewal cycle. 26 V.S.A. § 1400(b).

[FACT - STATUTE] All 30 hours must be AMA PRA Category 1 Credit™ from Board-approved CME providers. 26 V.S.A. § 1400(b).

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] Vermont's 30-hour requirement is lower than many states (e.g., Arizona 40, Tennessee 40), reflecting a less stringent approach to general CME volume.

### CME Category Specification

[FACT - STATUTE] All 30 hours must be AMA PRA Category 1 Credit™. No other CME categories are acceptable (no Category 2, no self-study alternatives unless accredited as Category 1). 26 V.S.A. § 1400(b).

[FACT - STATUTE] CME must be from Board-approved providers. Acceptable accreditation includes:
- ACCME (Accreditation Council for Continuing Medical Education)
- Other Board-approved continuing education accreditation bodies

26 V.S.A. § 1400(b)

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] Vermont's approach restricts CME to Category 1 credit only, similar to Arizona's MD requirement, creating clear compliance standards.

---

## 4. CME Topic Requirements

### Mandatory Topic 1: Palliative Care / Pain Management

[FACT - STATUTE] At least 1 hour of the 30-hour CME requirement must address:
- Hospice care, OR
- Palliative care, OR
- Pain management

26 V.S.A. § 1400(b)

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] This 1-hour requirement reflects Vermont's public health priorities in end-of-life and pain management education.

### Mandatory Topic 2: Controlled Substance Prescribing

[FACT - STATUTE] At least 2 hours of the 30-hour CME requirement must address controlled substance prescribing for physicians with DEA registrations. Required topics include:
- Abuse and diversion prevention
- Safe use and appropriate prescribing practices
- Proper storage and disposal protocols
- Vermont Prescription Monitoring System (PMS) requirements
- Risk assessment and patient evaluation protocols
- Alternatives to opioids
- Medication tapering protocols
- Relevant Vermont and federal laws

26 V.S.A. § 1400(b)

[CRITICAL GAP] The statute does not explicitly state whether the 2-hour controlled substance requirement applies to all MDs or only DEA registrants. Standard interpretation suggests it applies to DEA registrants based on statute language "for physicians with DEA registrations." Non-DEA registrants may not require this topic.

### Federal Opioid Requirement (One-Time)

[FACT - STATUTE] In addition to the biennial 30-hour CME, all DEA-registered practitioners must complete an 8-hour one-time training on treatment and management of patients with opioid or other substance use disorders. This is a federal requirement (Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2023) effective June 27, 2023. 26 V.S.A. § 1400(b).

[FACT - STATUTE] The 8-hour training is a one-time requirement, not recurring with each license renewal. 26 V.S.A. § 1400(b).

---

## 5. Controlled Substance Context

### Controlled Substance Prescribing CME

[FACT - STATUTE] Physicians with DEA registrations must complete 2 hours of CME covering controlled substance prescribing topics (abuse prevention, safe prescribing, storage/disposal, PMS requirements, alternatives to opioids, tapering protocols, relevant laws). 26 V.S.A. § 1400(b).

### Vermont Prescription Monitoring System (PMS)

[FACT - STATUTE] The 2-hour controlled substance CME must include Vermont Prescription Monitoring System requirements. Vermont physicians must understand and comply with PMS regulations as part of controlled substance management. 26 V.S.A. § 1400(b).

### Opioid Use Disorder Treatment Training

[FACT - STATUTE] All DEA-registered practitioners must complete an 8-hour training on treatment and management of opioid and substance use disorders (federal MATE Act requirement, effective June 27, 2023). This is separate from and in addition to the biennial CME. 26 V.S.A. § 1400(b).

---

## 6. Audit & Verification Procedures

### No Pre-Submission Verification

[FACT - STATUTE] Physicians are NOT required to submit CME verification documentation with their renewal application. The renewal application requires physician certification that CME requirements are met, but supporting documentation is not required upfront. 26 V.S.A. § 1400(b).

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] Vermont uses a trust-based model for initial compliance, with audit-based verification for selected licensees.

### Random Post-Renewal Audits

[FACT - STATUTE] The Board conducts random audits of CME records after each renewal cycle. Physicians selected for audit must promptly submit certificates and documentation. 26 V.S.A. § 1400(b).

[CRITICAL GAP] The statute does not specify the percentage of renewals audited (e.g., 5%, 10%, 20%). Audit rate should be clarified with the board.

### Audit Authority & Lookback Period

[FACT - STATUTE] The Board maintains a 4-year lookback authority for CME audits from the date of certification. 26 V.S.A. § 1400(b).

[FACT - STATUTE] Physicians must retain CME documentation for 4 years from the date of certification. Documentation must be available for Board inspection upon audit. 26 V.S.A. § 1400(b).

### Acceptable Documentation

[FACT - STATUTE] Acceptable CME documentation includes:
- Course completion certificates
- Official CME provider letters
- Transcripts showing course completion and hours
- Any evidence of course title, provider, hours completed, and date

26 V.S.A. § 1400(b)

### Non-Compliance Consequences

[FACT - STATUTE] Failure to submit CME documentation upon Board request may result in investigation for unprofessional conduct. Non-compliance with CME requirements may trigger license suspension or disciplinary action. 26 V.S.A. § 1400(b).

---

## 7. Exemptions & Alternatives

### Board Certification Exemptions

[CRITICAL GAP] Vermont statutes and administrative code do not provide an explicit board certification exemption from CME requirements. Based on statute review, board certification does NOT exempt physicians from the 30-hour CME requirement. All licensed physicians must meet the full 30-hour requirement regardless of board certification status.

### New Licensee Exemptions

[FACT - STATUTE] New licensees obtaining their first Vermont MD license may have partial-year CME requirements for their first renewal cycle, depending on timing of initial licensure. 26 V.S.A. § 1400(a).

[CRITICAL GAP] Specific new licensee CME calculations are not detailed in statute excerpts. This should be clarified with the board.

### Military Service Considerations

[CRITICAL GAP] The statute does not mention military service exemptions or waivers. Military status should be clarified with the board.

### Practice Requirement for Renewal

[FACT - STATUTE] To renew an active Vermont medical license, physicians must have practiced medicine in Vermont within the past 3 years, OR have complied with Board-approved requirements for "updating knowledge and skills." 26 V.S.A. § 1400(a).

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] This creates an implicit practice requirement - physicians who have not practiced in Vermont for 3+ years must demonstrate updated competency to renew.

---

## 8. CME Tracking Systems

### Physician Responsibility Model

[FACT - STATUTE] Vermont uses a physician-responsibility model for CME tracking. Physicians maintain their own CME records and certify completion on the renewal application. No pre-renewal documentation submission is required. 26 V.S.A. § 1400(b).

### eLicense Online System

[FACT - BOARD] Renewal applications are submitted through the eLicense Online system at https://mpb.health.vermont.gov/login.aspx. The system guides physicians through the renewal process and requires certification of CME compliance. (https://mpb.health.vermont.gov, accessed 2026-01-02)

### Documentation Retention Requirements

[FACT - STATUTE] Physicians must retain CME documentation for 4 years from the date of certification. Documentation includes course completion certificates, CME provider letters, transcripts, and any evidence of course completion. 26 V.S.A. § 1400(b).

### Audit-Based Verification

[FACT - STATUTE] Upon audit selection, the Board requests submission of CME documentation. Physicians must promptly respond with supporting documentation. Documentation sufficiency is determined by the Board. 26 V.S.A. § 1400(b).

---

## 9. Lapsed License Reinstatement

### No Grace Period - Immediate Lapse

[FACT - STATUTE] There is NO grace period for Vermont license renewal. If renewal is not completed by November 30, the license lapses immediately. Physicians cannot practice in Vermont with a lapsed license. 26 V.S.A. § 1400(a).

### Reinstatement Procedures Based on Lapse Duration

[FACT - STATUTE] Reinstatement procedures differ based on how long the license has been lapsed:

**If Lapsed < 1 Year:**
- Submit renewal application (not reinstatement application)
- Pay standard renewal fee ($525)
- May be required to pay late renewal penalty
- Must comply with all missed CME requirements
- May resume practice upon Board approval

**If Lapsed ≥ 1 Year:**
- Submit full reinstatement application (not standard renewal)
- Pay initial application fee ($650) - higher than renewal fee
- Provide chronological accounting of all professional activities in other jurisdictions during lapsed period
- May be required to re-demonstrate competency
- Must comply with all missed CME requirements
- Cannot engage in any medical practice until reinstatement is approved

26 V.S.A. § 1400(c)

### Practice Requirement for Reinstatement

[FACT - STATUTE] To qualify for reinstatement, physicians must either:
1. Have practiced medicine in Vermont within the past 3 years, OR
2. Have complied with Board-approved "updating knowledge and skills" requirements

26 V.S.A. § 1400(c)

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] Physicians with extended practice lapses may need to complete Board-approved CME or competency assessments beyond standard renewal requirements.

### Reinstatement Timeline

[CRITICAL GAP] The statute does not specify a processing timeline for reinstatement applications. Reinstatement timeline should be clarified with the board.

---

## 10. Renewal Fees & Timeline

### Fee Structure

[FACT - STATUTE] Vermont's renewal fee structure is:
- **License Renewal Fee:** $525.00 (biennial)
- **Initial License Fee:** $650.00 (one-time for new licensees)

26 V.S.A. § 1400(a)

[FACT - STATUTE] Late renewal penalties may apply if renewal is submitted after the November 30 expiration date, but the statute does not specify the penalty amount. 26 V.S.A. § 1400(a).

[CRITICAL GAP] Late renewal penalty amounts are not specified in statute excerpts. Penalty amounts should be clarified with the board.

### Renewal Timeline

[FACT - STATUTE] Licenses expire on November 30 of even-numbered years. Renewal must be completed by this date. The Board provides 90-day advance notice (approximately August 31) to allow preparation time. 26 V.S.A. § 1400(a).

[FACT - STATUTE] Renewal cycle is December 1 - November 30 of each two-year period. 26 V.S.A. § 1400(a).

### License Validity

[FACT - STATUTE] Upon successful renewal, the physician receives a license valid for 2 years (24 months), expiring November 30 of the next even-numbered year. 26 V.S.A. § 1400(a).

### Processing Timeline

[CRITICAL GAP] The statute does not specify how long the Board takes to process renewal applications. Processing timeline should be clarified with the board.

---

## 11. State-Specific Requirements

### Palliative/Pain Care Requirement (1 hour)

[FACT - STATUTE] Vermont uniquely requires 1 hour of palliative care, hospice care, or pain management CME as a mandatory topic. This reflects Vermont's public health priorities in end-of-life care. 26 V.S.A. § 1400(b).

### Vermont PMS Integration in Controlled Substance CME

[FACT - STATUTE] The 2-hour controlled substance CME must include Vermont Prescription Monitoring System requirements, emphasizing state-specific compliance. 26 V.S.A. § 1400(b).

### Practice Requirement for Active Renewal

[FACT - STATUTE] Active license renewal requires evidence of practice in Vermont within the past 3 years OR compliance with Board-approved updating knowledge/skills requirements. This creates a practice requirement unusual in some states. 26 V.S.A. § 1400(a).

### No Grace Period (Unique Strictness)

[FACT - STATUTE] Vermont provides NO grace period for renewal - immediate license lapse upon November 30 expiration. This is more stringent than most states which provide 30-180 day grace periods. 26 V.S.A. § 1400(a).

### Fixed Renewal Date (Not Individual)

[FACT - STATUTE] All Vermont MDs renew on the same date (November 30), unlike states with individual birthday-based renewal. This simplifies administrative tracking but requires unified renewal preparation. 26 V.S.A. § 1400(a).

---

## 12. CME Tracking & Reporting Systems

### Physician-Maintained Records Model

[FACT - STATUTE] Vermont requires physicians to maintain their own CME documentation. No third-party tracking system is mandated, and no pre-renewal verification is required. 26 V.S.A. § 1400(b).

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] This gives physicians flexibility in how to track CME but places the burden of organization and documentation on individual physicians.

### eLicense Online System

[FACT - BOARD] The Vermont Board's eLicense Online system at https://mpb.health.vermont.gov/login.aspx handles renewal applications. Physicians log in, complete the renewal form, attest to CME compliance, and submit payment. (https://mpb.health.vermont.gov, accessed 2026-01-02)

### No Mandatory CME Tracking Service

[CRITICAL GAP] Vermont does not mandate a specific CME tracking service (e.g., CE Broker). Unlike many states that provide free CE Broker accounts or integration, Vermont physicians are responsible for selecting their own tracking methods.

### Documentation Submission Upon Audit Only

[FACT - STATUTE] CME documentation is only submitted to the Board upon audit selection. If a physician is not audited, documentation remains with the physician for the 4-year retention period. 26 V.S.A. § 1400(b).

## Conclusion

Vermont's MD license renewal requirements are clear and relatively straightforward compared to many states:

1. **Lower CME Hour Requirement:** 30 hours (vs. 40 in many states) - represents a less stringent approach
2. **Mandatory Palliative/Pain Care:** Unique 1-hour requirement reflecting public health priorities
3. **No Grace Period:** More stringent than most states - immediate license lapse upon November 30
4. **Fixed Renewal Date:** All MDs renew November 30 of even years (simpler than individual-date systems)
5. **No CME Tracking Service Required:** Physicians maintain own records (flexibility but responsibility)
6. **Audit-Based Verification:** No pre-renewal documentation submission; audit-based approach
7. **Split-Board State:** Separate DO board under different agency with different requirements

**For Physician Compliance:** Track November 30 renewal deadline with no grace period, complete 30 hours AMA Category 1 CME (including 1 hour palliative/pain, 2 hours controlled substance if DEA registered), complete 8-hour federal opioid training (one-time if DEA registered), maintain 4-year record retention, and ensure practice status meets Vermont requirements.

**For Rules Engine Implementation:** Key complexity areas are:
- No grace period (strict expiration enforcement)
- Fixed population-wide renewal date (simpler than individual dates)
- Practice requirement for renewal (must track practice status in Vermont)
- Mandatory topic requirements (palliative care + controlled substance)
- Conditional opioid CME (one-time federal requirement)
- Lapsed license timeline-based procedures (different handling for < 1 year vs. ≥ 1 year)
