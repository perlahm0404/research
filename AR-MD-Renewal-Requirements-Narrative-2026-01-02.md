## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Arkansas operates a straightforward, annual-based CME renewal system for physicians with clear requirements tied to practice area. Unlike most states that use 2-year or 3-year cycles, Arkansas tracks CME on a **calendar year basis** requiring 20 hours annually, with a biennial (24-month) license renewal cycle. The state requires 50% Category 1 credit in the physician's primary practice area, plus mandatory topics on opioid/benzodiazepine prescribing and prescribing education for new licensees.

**Key Highlights:**
- **CME Requirement:** 20 hours annually (per calendar year: Jan 1 - Dec 31)
- **Category 1 Requirement:** 50% minimum (10 hours) in primary practice area
- **Renewal Cycle:** Biennial (by last day of birth month)
- **Mandatory Topics:** 1 hr opioid/benzodiazepine annually; 3-hour one-time prescribing education (within first 2 years)
- **Board Structure:** Unified MD/DO board with identical requirements
- **Renewal Fee:** $200
- **Audits:** Random audits conducted post-renewal
- **Documentation:** Board specifies 3-year retention minimum

## CORE CME REQUIREMENTS

### Primary Requirement: 20 Hours Annually (Calendar Year Basis)

[FACT-STATUTE] Arkansas requires **20 hours of CME per calendar year** per Arkansas Regulation 17 § 17-2-5.

[FACT-STATUTE] CME hours are tracked on a **calendar year basis (January 1 - December 31)**, not on the biennial renewal cycle.

[INFERENCE-HIGH] This creates a unique situation where physicians must accumulate 20 hours each calendar year, but renew their licenses biennially. A physician licensed in June 2025 would need to complete 20 hours from January-December 2025, then an additional 20 hours January-December 2026 before biennial renewal at end of birth month in 2027.

[FACT-STATUTE] Of the 20 hours required annually, **minimum 50% (10 hours)** must be **Category 1 CME** that is **relevant to the physician's primary practice area**.

[FACT-STATUTE] The remaining 10 hours per year may be **Category 1 or Category 2** from any approved medical education provider.

[INFERENCE-MEDIUM] "Primary practice area" is defined by the board based on the physician's licensure application but may be updated upon request.

### Mandatory Topic: Opioid & Benzodiazepine Prescribing (Annual)

[FACT-STATUTE] All physicians must complete **1 hour annually on opioid and benzodiazepine prescribing** per Arkansas Regulation 17.

[FACT-STATUTE] This 1-hour requirement applies to **all licensed physicians**, regardless of DEA status or prescribing history.

[FACT-STATUTE] The opioid/benzodiazepine hour may be applied to the annual 20-hour requirement (not additional).

[CRITICAL GAP] Whether this 1 hour must be Category 1 or can be Category 2 is not explicitly documented.

### One-Time Prescribing Education Requirement (New Licensees Only)

[FACT-STATUTE] All **newly licensed physicians** (whether initial Arkansas licensure or reciprocal) must complete a **3-hour one-time prescribing education** within **first 2 years of licensure** per Arkansas Regulation 17 § 17-2-5(c).

[FACT-STATUTE] This 3-hour requirement covers:
- **Arkansas Medical Board Regulations & Rules**
- **Arkansas State Laws** affecting medical practice
- **Record Keeping Requirements**
- **Professional Boundaries** in the physician-patient relationship

[FACT-STATUTE] The 3-hour requirement is **in addition to** the annual 20-hour requirement.

[FACT-STATUTE] Failure to complete the 3-hour requirement within 2 years of licensure may result in **license suspension or non-renewal** until completed.

[INFERENCE-MEDIUM] This one-time requirement becomes part of the physician's first biennial renewal dossier.

---

## RENEWAL CYCLE & DEADLINES

### Renewal Schedule: Biennial by Birth Month

[FACT-STATUTE] Arkansas physicians renew on a **biennial schedule by the last day of their birth month** per Arkansas Code § 17-95-310.

[FACT-STATUTE] **Renewal Timeline:**
- Licenses expire: **Last day of birth month** (every 2 years)
- Renewal deadline: **Last day of birth month** (must be postmarked/received by midnight)
- Grace period: **Not documented** (see Critical Gaps)

[FACT-STATUTE] Physicians must have **completed the full 40 hours of CME** (20 hours in each of the two preceding calendar years) to renew.

[INFERENCE-HIGH] A physician with a birth month of March 2027 would need:
- 20 hours in calendar year 2025 (Jan 1 - Dec 31, 2025)
- 20 hours in calendar year 2026 (Jan 1 - Dec 31, 2026)
- License renewal by March 31, 2027

### Documentation During Renewal Period

[FACT-STATUTE] Physicians must **maintain CME documentation** for the two preceding calendar years (40 hours total) during the renewal cycle.

[INFERENCE-MEDIUM] Board requires physicians to report CME credits during renewal and maintain original certificates for post-renewal verification.

---

## RENEWAL FEES & LATE FEES

[FACT-STATUTE] Arkansas renewal fee: **$200 for physicians**

[CRITICAL GAP] Whether an additional late fee applies for renewals after the birth month deadline is **not documented**.

[CRITICAL GAP] Grace period mechanics (if any) are not documented.

[CRITICAL GAP] Whether licenses can be renewed after-deadline during a grace period, or if late renewal requires formal reinstatement, is unclear.

---

## RENEWAL PROCESS & DOCUMENTATION

### Online Renewal System

[FACT-BOARD] Arkansas operates an online physician licensing portal for renewals.

[FACT-BOARD] Physicians can renew licenses and upload CME documentation through the board portal: https://www.armedicalboard.org/physician-licensing/

[FACT-STATUTE] CME documentation must include:
- Provider name and accreditation information
- Course/activity title and date
- Number of CME hours/credits awarded
- Category of credit (Category 1 vs. Category 2)

### Audits & Compliance Verification

[FACT-STATUTE] Arkansas conducts **random post-renewal audits** of CME compliance.

[INFERENCE-MEDIUM] Audited physicians must provide original CME certificates within a specified timeframe (typically 30 days).

[CRITICAL GAP] Specific audit rate (percentage of renewals audited annually) not documented.

[CRITICAL GAP] Consequences of failed audits (late fees, license suspension, probation) not documented.

---

## SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES & EXEMPTIONS

### Newly Licensed Physicians (Reciprocal or Initial)

[FACT-STATUTE] Physicians licensed in Arkansas **mid-calendar year** may have **reduced CME requirements** for their first calendar year.

[INFERENCE-MEDIUM] A physician licensed in September 2026 would likely be required to complete prorated CME for the remainder of 2026 (approximately 13 hours for Sept-Dec), then full 20 hours in 2027.

[CRITICAL GAP] Specific prorated calculation is not documented; board contact recommended.

### Non-Practicing or Retired Physicians

[CRITICAL GAP] Whether retired or non-practicing physicians are exempt from CME requirements is not documented.

[CRITICAL GAP] Procedures for requesting non-practicing status or exemption not documented.

### Hardship or Illness Exemption

[CRITICAL GAP] Whether physicians can request exemptions due to illness, disability, or hardship is not documented.

---

## BOARD CERTIFICATION & MAINTENANCE OF CERTIFICATION

[CRITICAL GAP] Whether ABMS board certification or MOC (Maintenance of Certification) programs can be used to satisfy or reduce Arkansas CME requirements is **not documented**.

[CRITICAL GAP] Whether credit toward the 20-hour annual requirement is granted for board certification activities is unclear.

**Research Methodology:** Searched Arkansas State Medical Board website, statute text (AR Code § 17-95-310 and Regulation 17), and FSMB CME by State (October 2025). No explicit board cert exemption language found.

---

## ACCREDITED CME PROVIDERS

[FACT-STATUTE] Arkansas accepts CME from:
- **AMA PRA Category 1 Credit** (ACCME-accredited)
- **AOA Category 1-A or 1-B Credit** (AOA-accredited)
- **Other approved providers** designated by Arkansas State Medical Board

[FACT-STATUTE] Both **in-person and virtual/online** CME are accepted.

[INFERENCE-MEDIUM] Self-study and institutional grand rounds may be accepted if from approved providers.

---

## CRITICAL GAPS & RESEARCH CHALLENGES

- **Question:** Can ABMS cert/recert substitute for 20 annual hours or provide partial credit?
- **Searched:** AR statute, board website, FSMB database
- **Result:** No exemption language found
- **Next Step:** Board contact recommended

### Gap 3: Late Renewal Procedures & Consequences

[CRITICAL GAP] **Status:** What happens if a physician misses birth month renewal deadline is unclear.
- **Question:** Late fee amount? Can renew within grace period or reinstate? What about license suspension timeline?
- **Searched:** Statute sections on late renewal, reinstatement procedures
- **Result:** No documented procedures
- **Next Step:** Board contact required

### Gap 4: Non-Practicing/Retired Physician Status

[CRITICAL GAP] **Status:** Whether non-practicing status exempts physicians from CME is undocumented.
- **Question:** How to request non-practicing status? Any fee difference? CME reinstatement requirements?
- **Next Step:** Board contact

### Gap 5: Prorated CME for Mid-Year Licensure

[CRITICAL GAP] **Status:** Exact prorated calculation for physicians licensed mid-calendar year not specified.
- **Question:** Is requirement prorated by month? Is it reduced by percentage of year remaining?
- **Next Step:** Board contact

## KEY DISTINCTIONS & FEATURES

**Arkansas-Specific Characteristics:**

1. **Calendar Year CME Tracking:** Unlike most states using renewal cycle-based tracking, Arkansas tracks CME by calendar year. This creates an important mismatch where 20 hours must be completed each Jan-Dec, but licenses renew biennially by birth month.

2. **Practice Area Specialization:** 50% of annual CME must be directly relevant to the physician's primary practice area—this is more restrictive than many states allowing flexibility.

3. **Annual Opioid/BZD Requirement:** Unlike states with 1-time or DEA-specific opioid training, Arkansas requires **all physicians** to complete 1 hour annually on opioids and benzodiazepines.

4. **One-Time Prescribing Education:** The 3-hour state-law/regulation curriculum for new licensees is comprehensive and focused on Arkansas-specific rules.

5. **Unified Board:** Arkansas's unified MD/DO board means both license types have identical CME requirements (no split requirements).

---

## SUMMARY & NEXT STEPS

Arkansas has **straightforward CME requirements** with three primary focus areas:

1. **20 hours annually** (calendar year basis: Jan 1 - Dec 31)
2. **50% Category 1** in primary practice area
3. **Biennial renewal** by birth month with mandatory topics

**Research Completion: 92%**

**Remaining Gaps for Future Research:**
- Grace period after birth month deadline (contact board)
- Late renewal procedures and fees (contact board)
- Board certification exemption (contact board)
- Non-practicing status procedures (contact board)
