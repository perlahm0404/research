**Date:** January 2, 2026
**Focus:** Integration of new research findings into comprehensive renewal document
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED

---

## SESSION OVERVIEW

This session focused on reviewing newly discovered research findings and integrating them into the comprehensive Massachusetts MD renewal requirements document. The findings came from direct contact with BORIM (Board of Registration in Medicine) resources and were compiled in the `MISSING_INFORMATION-Massachusetts-MD.md` file.

### Key Accomplishment
Successfully updated the comprehensive document with 9 critical research findings that resolved or partially resolved major gaps in the knowledge base.

---

## FINDINGS INTEGRATED

### Gap #1: Certificate Upload Requirement
**Status:** ✅ **RESOLVED** (HIGH Confidence)

**Finding:**
Physicians do NOT need to upload/attach CME certificates with their renewal. The FAQ explicitly states: "You do not submit documentation of CME credits with your renewal form. Keep your own records, as the Board expects you to be able to document CME credits."

**Source:** General Physician Licensing Questions FAQ, BORIM website
**Quote:** "Do I send documentation of CME credits with the license renewal form? You do not submit documentation of CME credits with your renewal form. Keep your own records, as the Board expects you to be able to document CME credits."

**Document Location Updated:**
- Verification and Audit Process > At Renewal - Verification Method > Documentation Requirements (line 555-567)

**Audit Implications:**
Physicians must retain CME documentation for audit purposes if selected. The Board expects physicians to be able to produce evidence if audited.

---

### Gap #2: Lapsed License Reinstatement Procedures
**Status:** ⚠️ **PARTIAL** (MEDIUM Confidence)

**Findings:**
- General Process: A lapsed license application is for a physician whose license expired for nonrenewal
- Fee: $700.00

**Source:**
- General Physician Licensing Questions FAQ
- Policy 03-03 reference (Adopted November 12, 2003; amended June 28, 2018)

**Quote:**
"If the physician has not engaged in the clinical practice of medicine for two years or more and intends to return to a practice of medicine that will include direct or indirect patient care, the Board may require that the physician demonstrate current clinical competency prior to reviving the license."

**Document Location Updated:**

**Source:** Policy 94-05 (listed on Physician Regulations, Policies, and Guidelines page)

**Quote:** "No, 50 CME credits must be earned during each license renewal cycle" (regarding carrying forward excess credits)

**Document Location Updated:**
