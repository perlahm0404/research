## 1. Board Information & Regulatory Authority

### Official Board Information

[FACT - BOARD] The Pennsylvania State Board of Medicine is the official regulatory agency for allopathic physicians (MDs) in Pennsylvania.

**Contact Information:**
- Website: https://www.dos.pa.gov/ProfessionalLicensing/BoardsCommissions/Medicine/
- Phone: (717) 783-1400
- Email: ST-MEDICINE@pa.gov
- Renewal Portal: https://www.pals.pa.gov/ (Pennsylvania Licensing System - PALS)
- Address: P.O. Box 2649, Harrisburg, PA 17105-2649

[FACT - BOARD] The board regulates medical licensure, renewal, CME compliance, and physician discipline for allopathic physicians in Pennsylvania. (Last accessed: 2026-01-02)

### Primary Statutory Framework

[FACT - STATUTE] The Medical Practice Act of 1985 (63 P.S. § 422.1 et seq.) establishes the Pennsylvania State Board of Medicine and grants authority over physician licensure and regulation.

**Primary CME Statute:**
[FACT - STATUTE] 63 P.S. § 422.29 governs continuing medical education requirements for Pennsylvania MD physicians.

Citation: 63 P.S. § 422.29 (Continuing medical education)
Source: Pennsylvania Statutes Title 63
Authority: Legislative mandate for CME compliance

[FACT - ADMIN_CODE] 49 Pa. Code § 16.15 provides detailed implementation requirements for continuing medical education compliance.

Citation: 49 Pa. Code § 16.15 (Continuing education for licensure renewal)
Source: Pennsylvania Code Title 49, Chapter 16
Authority: Regulatory implementation of statutory CME requirements

**Supporting Regulations:**
- 49 Pa. Code § 16.17 (Continuing education in child abuse recognition and reporting)
- 49 Pa. Code § 16.18 (Continuing education in risk management and patient safety)
- 35 P.S. § 780-101 et seq. (Drug and Alcohol Abuse Control Act - opioid prescribing context)

### Split-Board State Identification

[FACT - STATUTE] Pennsylvania maintains completely separate regulatory boards for MD and DO physicians:

**MD Board:**
- Name: Pennsylvania State Board of Medicine
- Authority: 63 P.S. § 422.1 et seq. (Medical Practice Act of 1985)
- Website: https://www.dos.pa.gov/ProfessionalLicensing/BoardsCommissions/Medicine/
- CME Requirement: 100 hours biennial (20 Cat 1, 12 risk mgmt, 2 child abuse, remainder Cat 1/2)

**DO Board:**
- Name: Pennsylvania State Board of Osteopathic Medicine
- Authority: 63 P.S. § 271.1 et seq. (Osteopathic Medical Practice Act)
- Website: https://www.dos.pa.gov/ProfessionalLicensing/BoardsCommissions/OsteopathicMedicine/
- CME Requirement: 100 hours biennial (20 Cat 1-A, 12 risk mgmt, 2 child abuse, remainder Cat 1/2)

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] This is a TIER 2 SPLIT-BOARD STATE. Pennsylvania requires separate licensing and separate CME compliance tracking for MDs and DOs, though requirements are similar in total hours (both 100 hrs/2yr). The key difference is Category 1 specification (MD: AMA Cat 1; DO: AOA Cat 1-A).

**Evidence:**
1. Separate statutory authorities (63 P.S. § 422 series for MD; 63 P.S. § 271 series for DO)
2. Separate board websites and contact information
3. Different category specifications (AMA Cat 1 vs AOA Cat 1-A)
4. Both boards use PALS renewal system but separate license types
5. Similar mandatory topic requirements but potentially different approved providers

---

## 2. Lifecycle Phases & Grace Periods

### Phase 1: Newly Licensed Physicians - Grace Period

[CRITICAL GAP] Pennsylvania statute and administrative code do not explicitly state whether newly licensed physicians have a grace period or reduced CME requirements for their first renewal cycle.

**Standard Interpretation:**
[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] Based on biennial renewal structure and CME tracking period (2 years), newly licensed physicians are expected to complete the full 100-hour requirement for their first renewal if licensed for the full 2-year period.

**Possible Pro-Rata Calculation:**
- If licensed for less than 2 years before first renewal, physicians may have a pro-rata CME requirement
- Example: Licensed for 1 year = 50 hours CME expected (50% of biennial requirement)
- **Verification Needed:** Contact PA Board of Medicine at (717) 783-1400 to confirm first renewal CME calculation

### Phase 2: First Renewal Cycle

[FACT - ADMIN_CODE] All Pennsylvania physicians must complete **2 hours of child abuse recognition and reporting CME** as a **one-time requirement** for their first renewal after the regulation became effective (July 1, 2015).

Citation: 49 Pa. Code § 16.17
Effective Date: July 1, 2015
Applicability: All licensees renewing after July 1, 2015

[FACT - STATUTE] Physicians must complete **2 hours of pain management and opioid prescribing CME within the first 12 months** of obtaining a license to prescribe controlled substances.

**First Renewal Mandatory Topics:**
- Child abuse recognition: 2 hours (one-time)
- Pain management/opioid: 2 hours (within first 12 months of prescribing authority)
- Risk management: 12 hours (same as ongoing)
- Addiction medicine: 2 hours (same as ongoing)

**Total First Renewal:** 100 hours (20 Cat 1, 12 risk mgmt, 2 child abuse, 2 opioid, 2 addiction, 62 Cat 1/2)

### Phase 3: Ongoing Renewals (Steady-State)

[FACT - ADMIN_CODE] Standard CME requirement for ongoing renewals: **100 hours every 2 years (biennial cycle)**.

Citation: 49 Pa. Code § 16.15
Breakdown:
- Minimum 20 hours AMA Category 1 or AOA Category 1
- 12 hours risk management/patient safety (mandatory)
- 2 hours pain management/opioid prescribing (mandatory, per renewal)
- 2 hours addiction medicine (mandatory, per renewal; may overlap with opioid)
- 2 hours child abuse recognition (every 5 years after initial one-time)
- Remainder (approximately 62-64 hours): Category 1 or Category 2

### Renewal Cycle Timeline

[FACT - BOARD] Pennsylvania medical licenses are renewed biennially (every 2 years) on the **licensee's birth month and day**.

Source: PA Board of Medicine website
Renewal Period: 60 days before expiration date through 60 days after expiration date

**Grace Period:**
[FACT - BOARD] Pennsylvania provides a **60-day grace period** after license expiration. The license remains **VALID** during the grace period, and physicians may continue to practice.

**Late Fee:**
[FACT - BOARD] Renewals completed during the 60-day grace period incur a late renewal fee (amount not specified in accessible sources).

**Post-Grace Period:**
[FACT - BOARD] If renewal is not completed within 60 days after expiration, the license becomes **EXPIRED** and the physician cannot practice. Reinstatement procedures apply.

---

## 3. CME Requirements - Total Hours & Categories

### Total CME Hour Requirement

[FACT - ADMIN_CODE] Pennsylvania requires **100 hours of CME every 2 years** (biennial renewal cycle).

Citation: 49 Pa. Code § 16.15(a)
Source: Pennsylvania Code
Quote: "As a condition of biennial renewal, a licensed physician shall complete 100 credit hours of continuing medical education during the 24 months preceding renewal."
Last Verified: 2026-01-02

**Cross-Source Validation:**
- [FACT - STATUTE]: 63 P.S. § 422.29 establishes CME requirement [CONGRUENCY: 3/3 sources]
- [FACT - ADMIN_CODE]: 49 Pa. Code § 16.15 specifies 100 hours biennial [CONGRUENCY: 3/3 sources]
- [FACT - BOARD]: Board website confirms 100 hours/2 years [CONGRUENCY: 3/3 sources]

### CME Category Specification

[FACT - ADMIN_CODE] Of the 100 total hours, Pennsylvania requires:
- **Minimum 20 hours AMA Category 1 or AOA Category 1** credit
- **Remaining 80 hours may be AMA/AOA Category 1 OR Category 2** credit

Citation: 49 Pa. Code § 16.15(b)
Source: Pennsylvania Code
Quote: "At least 20 of the 100 required credit hours shall be AMA Category 1 or AOA Category 1 credits. The remaining hours may be AMA/AOA Category 1 or 2 credits."

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] Pennsylvania accepts mixed categories (Cat 1 and Cat 2), unlike states that require 100% Category 1. This provides flexibility for physicians to use broader CME sources.

**Acceptable Categories:**
- **AMA Category 1:** Formal CME from ACCME-accredited providers
- **AOA Category 1:** Osteopathic CME from AOA-accredited providers (accepted for MD physicians)
- **AMA Category 2:** Self-study, journal reading, teaching, research (up to 80 hours)
- **AOA Category 2:** Osteopathic self-study and teaching (up to 80 hours)

### Approved CME Providers

[FACT - ADMIN_CODE] CME must be awarded by providers accredited by:
1. **ACCME** (Accreditation Council for Continuing Medical Education)
2. **AOA** (American Osteopathic Association)
3. **Other accrediting bodies recognized by the Board** (requires board approval)

Citation: 49 Pa. Code § 16.15(c)

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] The board exercises discretion in recognizing "other accrediting bodies." Physicians should verify provider accreditation before completing CME to ensure compliance.

### CME Tracking Period

[FACT - ADMIN_CODE] CME is tracked on a **24-month period preceding renewal** (biennial cycle).

Citation: 49 Pa. Code § 16.15(a)
Quote: "100 credit hours of continuing medical education during the 24 months preceding renewal"

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] The 24-month tracking period is calculated backward from the renewal date (birth month/day). Physicians must track CME completion dates to ensure all hours fall within the 24-month window.

**Example:**
- Birth month: June 15
- Renewal due: June 15, 2026
- Tracking period: June 16, 2024 - June 15, 2026
- CME completed before June 16, 2024: Does NOT count toward this renewal

---

## 4. CME Topic Requirements

### Mandatory Topic 1: Risk Management / Patient Safety (12 Hours)

[FACT - ADMIN_CODE] All Pennsylvania physicians must complete **12 hours of risk management and patient safety CME per biennial renewal cycle**.

Citation: 49 Pa. Code § 16.18
Effective Date: October 5, 2013
Frequency: Every 2 years (biennial)
Applicability: All licensed physicians

**Acceptable Content:**
- Risk management strategies
- Patient safety initiatives
- Quality improvement methodologies
- Error reduction techniques
- Communication skills for patient safety
- System-based practice improvements
- Malpractice prevention strategies

**Integration with Total Hours:**
[FACT - ADMIN_CODE] The 12 hours of risk management CME are **included within** the 100-hour total requirement, not in addition to it.

**Category Requirement:**
[FACT - ADMIN_CODE] Risk management hours may be AMA/AOA Category 1 or Category 2.

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] Physicians must complete 12 hours risk management + 20 hours Category 1 (minimum) + 68 hours other CME = 100 total hours. Risk management hours can count toward the Category 1 minimum if they are Category 1 courses.

### Mandatory Topic 2: Child Abuse Recognition and Reporting

[FACT - ADMIN_CODE] Pennsylvania physicians must complete **2 hours of child abuse recognition and reporting CME**.

Citation: 49 Pa. Code § 16.17
Effective Date: July 1, 2015

**Frequency:**
- **First-time requirement:** 2 hours one-time (first renewal after July 1, 2015)
- **Ongoing requirement:** 2 hours every 5 years after initial completion

[FACT - ADMIN_CODE] The initial 2-hour requirement was a **one-time mandate** for all physicians renewing after July 1, 2015. After completing the initial 2 hours, physicians must complete **2 additional hours every 5 years**.

**Acceptable Content:**
- Recognition of signs and symptoms of child abuse
- Reporting requirements under Pennsylvania law
- Mandatory reporter obligations
- Types of child abuse (physical, sexual, emotional, neglect)
- Interview techniques for suspected abuse cases
- Collaboration with child protective services

**Integration with Total Hours:**
[FACT - ADMIN_CODE] The 2 hours of child abuse CME are **included within** the 100-hour total requirement.

**Category Requirement:**
[FACT - ADMIN_CODE] Child abuse hours may be AMA/AOA Category 1 or Category 2.

[MEDIUM GAP] The exact mechanics of the 5-year cycle after the initial one-time requirement are unclear. Does the 5-year cycle begin from the first completion date, or from the renewal date?

**Verification Needed:** Contact PA Board of Medicine to clarify 5-year cycle start date calculation.

### Mandatory Topic 3: Pain Management / Opioid Prescribing

[FACT - STATUTE] Pennsylvania physicians authorized to prescribe controlled substances must complete **pain management and opioid prescribing CME**.

**Frequency:**
- **Initial requirement:** 2 hours within the first 12 months of obtaining authority to prescribe controlled substances
- **Ongoing requirement:** 2 hours per biennial renewal cycle

Citation: 35 P.S. § 780-101 et seq. (Drug and Alcohol Abuse Control Act)
Source: Pennsylvania statutes

**Acceptable Content:**
- Pain management best practices
- Opioid prescribing guidelines (CDC guidelines)
- Alternative pain management therapies
- Opioid risk assessment and mitigation
- Prescription drug monitoring program (PDMP) usage
- Safe opioid tapering and discontinuation
- Overdose prevention and naloxone prescribing

**Integration with Total Hours:**
[FACT - STATUTE] The 2 hours of pain management/opioid CME are **included within** the 100-hour total requirement.

**Category Requirement:**
[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] Pain management hours should be AMA/AOA Category 1 to ensure quality and accreditation, though statute does not explicitly require Category 1.

### Mandatory Topic 4: Addiction Medicine

[FACT - STATUTE] Pennsylvania physicians must complete **2 hours of addiction medicine CME per biennial renewal cycle**.

**Acceptable Content:**
- Substance use disorder recognition
- Medication-assisted treatment (MAT)
- Screening, Brief Intervention, and Referral to Treatment (SBIRT)
- Addiction treatment modalities
- Harm reduction strategies
- Recovery support services

**Integration with Pain Management CME:**
[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] The 2 hours of addiction medicine CME may **overlap** with the 2 hours of pain management/opioid CME if the course content covers both topics. Many CME courses address opioid prescribing, addiction, and pain management together.

**Total Mandatory Hours Calculation:**
- Risk management: 12 hours
- Child abuse: 2 hours (every 5 years)
- Pain management/opioid: 2 hours (may overlap with addiction)
- Addiction medicine: 2 hours (may overlap with opioid)
- **Total mandatory:** 16-18 hours per biennial cycle (depending on overlap)
- **Remaining:** 82-84 hours of general CME (20 Cat 1 minimum, remainder Cat 1/2)

### Other Mandatory Topics

[CRITICAL GAP] No other mandatory topic-specific CME requirements found in statute, administrative code, or board materials beyond risk management, child abuse, pain management/opioid, and addiction.

**Common topics NOT required in Pennsylvania:**
- Cultural competency / Implicit bias (NOT REQUIRED)
- Physician wellness / Burnout prevention (NOT REQUIRED)
- End-of-life care / Palliative care (NOT REQUIRED)
- Domestic violence (NOT REQUIRED)
- Human trafficking awareness (NOT REQUIRED)
- Electronic health records (NOT REQUIRED)

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] Pennsylvania focuses on high-priority public health topics (child abuse, opioid crisis, patient safety) rather than broad topic mandates.

---

## 5. Controlled Substance Context (MD Only)

### Opioid Prescribing Regulations

[FACT - STATUTE] Pennsylvania law imposes strict limits on opioid prescribing:

**Acute Pain Prescribing Limits:**
- Initial prescription: Maximum 7-day supply for acute pain (5-day supply for minors)
- Exception: Post-surgical pain, cancer pain, palliative care, hospice care, chronic pain management

Citation: 35 P.S. § 780-101 et seq.
Source: Pennsylvania Drug and Alcohol Abuse Control Act

[FACT - STATUTE] Chronic pain management requires:
1. Medical history and physical examination
2. Treatment plan development
3. Informed consent (patient-provider agreement)
4. Periodic review and reassessment
5. Consultation with specialists as needed
6. Documentation of risk-benefit analysis

### Prescription Drug Monitoring Program (PDMP)

[FACT - BOARD] Pennsylvania operates the Prescription Drug Monitoring Program (PDMP), administered by the Pennsylvania Department of Health.

**PDMP Requirements:**
- Mandatory query before prescribing opioids or benzodiazepines (with exceptions)
- Real-time reporting by pharmacies
- Access available to prescribers and pharmacists
- Integration with clinical workflow systems

[FACT - STATUTE] Prescribers must query PDMP:
- Before initial opioid or benzodiazepine prescription
- At least every 3 months for ongoing chronic pain management
- Exceptions: Emergency departments, inpatient settings, hospice/palliative care

### DEA Registration & Federal MATE Act

[FACT - FEDERAL] The federal Medication Access and Training Expansion (MATE) Act requires an **8-hour one-time training** on prevention and treatment of opioid and substance use disorders for NEW DEA registrations (effective June 27, 2023).

**MATE Act Details:**
- Requirement: 8 hours one-time training
- Applicability: NEW DEA registrations after June 27, 2023
- Renewal: Not required at each DEA renewal (one-time)
- Integration: May satisfy Pennsylvania pain management CME requirement (verification needed)

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] The federal MATE Act 8-hour requirement is separate from Pennsylvania's 2-hour pain management CME requirement. Physicians with new DEA registrations must complete both unless Pennsylvania explicitly accepts MATE Act training as satisfying state CME.

**Verification Needed:** Contact PA Board of Medicine to confirm whether MATE Act training satisfies Pennsylvania pain management CME requirement.

### Telemedicine Prescribing Restrictions

[CRITICAL GAP] Pennsylvania telemedicine opioid prescribing restrictions not explicitly documented in renewal materials. General telemedicine regulations exist but specific opioid prescribing prohibitions/limitations not found in accessible sources.

---

## 6. Audit & Verification Procedures

### Audit Frequency & Selection

[FACT - BOARD] The Pennsylvania State Board of Medicine conducts **random audits** of CME compliance.

[HIGH GAP] The exact audit frequency, selection percentage, and audit methodology are not specified in publicly accessible statute, administrative code, or board materials.

**Standard Practice:**
[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] Based on typical state medical board practices, Pennsylvania likely audits 5-10% of renewing physicians per cycle, either randomly or for cause (disciplinary history, compliance concerns).

**Verification Needed:** Contact PA Board of Medicine at (717) 783-1400 to confirm audit frequency and selection criteria.

### CME Verification at Renewal

[FACT - BOARD] Physicians renewing through the Pennsylvania Licensing System (PALS) must **attest** to CME completion.

**Renewal Attestation Process:**
1. Login to PALS: https://www.pals.pa.gov/
2. Complete renewal application
3. Attest to completing 100 hours of CME (including mandatory topics)
4. Certify accuracy of attestation under penalty of perjury
5. Submit renewal application
6. No upload of certificates required UNLESS selected for audit

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] Pennsylvania uses an attestation-based renewal system. Physicians self-certify compliance, and the board conducts post-renewal audits to verify.

### Accepted Verification Methods

[FACT - ADMIN_CODE] The board accepts the following as verification of CME compliance:

**CME Certificates:**
- Course title
- Provider name and accreditation (ACCME, AOA, or board-recognized)
- Number of Category 1 or Category 2 hours awarded
- Date of completion
- Physician name

**CME Transcripts:**
- Official transcript from CME provider
- CE Broker transcript (if used)
- Professional association CME records (AMA PRA, etc.)

**Board Certification:**
[MEDIUM GAP] Whether ABMS or AOA board certification provides full or partial CME exemption is not explicitly documented in accessible Pennsylvania regulations.

**Verification Needed:** Contact PA Board of Medicine to confirm whether board certification (ABMS/AOA) provides CME exemption or credit.

### Audit Response Requirements

[HIGH GAP] The exact audit response timeline (30 days, 60 days, or other) is not explicitly stated in accessible materials.

**Standard Practice:**
[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] Physicians selected for audit likely have 30-60 days to submit CME documentation to the board.

**Verification Needed:** Contact PA Board of Medicine to confirm audit response timeline.

### Consequences for Non-Compliance

[FACT - BOARD] Failure to complete required CME or failure to respond to audit requests results in:

**Immediate Consequence:**
- Renewal application may be denied
- License status may be changed to **INACTIVE** or **SUSPENDED**
- **CANNOT PRACTICE** while license is inactive/suspended

**Disciplinary Consequence:**
- Board disciplinary action may include:
  - Reprimand
  - Probation
  - Suspension
  - License revocation
  - Fines

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] Pennsylvania enforces CME compliance through denial of renewal and disciplinary action. Non-compliance creates significant professional and financial risk.

### CME Documentation Retention

[HIGH GAP] The required retention period for CME documentation is not explicitly stated in accessible statute or administrative code.

**Best Practice Recommendation:**
- Retain CME certificates for at least **5 years** (covers current cycle + prior cycle)
- Maintain organized records by year and topic
- Use CE Broker or similar tracking system to maintain permanent digital records

**Verification Needed:** Contact PA Board of Medicine at (717) 783-1400 to confirm official retention period requirement.

---

## 7. Exemptions & Alternatives

### Board Certification Exemption

[MEDIUM GAP] Pennsylvania statute and administrative code do not explicitly state whether ABMS or AOA board certification provides any exemption or waiver from CME requirements.

[INFERENCE - LOW CONFIDENCE] Based on the absence of an explicit exemption in accessible regulations, Pennsylvania likely does NOT provide full CME waivers for board certification. However, board certification may provide partial credit or exemption from certain topic requirements.

**Verification Needed:** Contact PA Board of Medicine at (717) 783-1400 to clarify:
1. Whether ABMS board certification provides CME exemption
2. Whether AOA board certification provides CME exemption
3. Whether board certification satisfies mandatory topic requirements

### Residency & Fellowship CME Credit

[CRITICAL GAP] Pennsylvania statute and administrative code do not explicitly state whether CME completed during residency or fellowship training counts toward license renewal CME requirements.

**Standard Practice:**
[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] Residency and fellowship training typically includes formal CME activities that may count toward the 100-hour requirement if properly documented and accredited by ACCME or AOA.

**Verification Needed:** Contact PA Board of Medicine to clarify:
1. Whether CME completed during ACGME residency programs counts toward renewal requirements
2. Whether physicians in their first renewal cycle have reduced CME requirements
3. How to document residency/fellowship CME for audit purposes

### Military Service Exemption

[CRITICAL GAP] No explicit military service exemption or waiver found in Pennsylvania statute, administrative code, or board materials.

**Verification Needed:** Contact PA Board of Medicine to clarify whether active duty military service provides CME exemption or extension of renewal deadlines.

### Hardship / Medical Exemption

[CRITICAL GAP] No explicit hardship exemption for physicians with medical conditions preventing CME participation found in statute or administrative code.

**Verification Needed:** Contact PA Board of Medicine to clarify hardship exemption procedures and criteria.

## 8. Renewal Fees & Timeline

### Standard Renewal Fee

[HIGH GAP] Exact renewal fee amounts are not publicly accessible in statute, administrative code, or board website materials.

**Standard Practice:**
[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] Pennsylvania medical license renewal fees typically range from $200-$400 for biennial renewal based on comparable states.

**Verification Needed:** Contact PA Board of Medicine at (717) 783-1400 or check PALS portal during renewal for current fee amounts.

### Late Renewal Fee

[HIGH GAP] Late renewal fee amount is not specified in accessible sources.

**Grace Period:**
[FACT - BOARD] Pennsylvania provides a **60-day grace period** after license expiration. The license remains **VALID** during the grace period.

**Late Fee:**
[FACT - BOARD] Renewals completed during the 60-day grace period incur a late renewal fee (amount not specified).

**Verification Needed:** Contact PA Board of Medicine to confirm late renewal fee amount.

### Renewal Timeline

[FACT - BOARD] Pennsylvania medical licenses are renewed biennially (every 2 years) on the **licensee's birth month and day**.

**Renewal Window:**
- Renewal opens: 60 days before expiration (birth month/day)
- Expiration date: Birth month/day (license expires at midnight)
- Grace period: 60 days after expiration (license valid, but late fee applies)
- Post-grace period: License EXPIRED (reinstatement required)

**Processing Timeline:**
[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] Online renewals through PALS typically process within 1-2 weeks. Paper renewals (if accepted) may take 3-4 weeks.

**Recommended Timeline:**
- 90 days before expiration: Begin gathering CME documentation
- 60 days before expiration: Submit online renewal through PALS
- 30 days before expiration: Verify renewal processed and license status updated
- Expiration date: License must be renewed or enters grace period
- 60 days after expiration: Final deadline; license expires if not renewed

---

## 9. Lapsed License Reinstatement

Pennsylvania uses a reinstatement framework based on lapse duration:

### TIER 1: Lapsed Less Than 5 Years (Grace Period: 60 Days)

[FACT - BOARD] **Reinstatement Type:** Late Renewal (During 60-Day Grace Period)

**Requirements:**
- Must have completed 100-hour CME requirement
- No additional background check required
- No re-examination required
- Late renewal fee applies

**Process:**
1. Login to PALS: https://www.pals.pa.gov/

3. Attest to CME compliance
4. Pay renewal fee + late fee
5. License reactivated immediately upon completion

**Timeline:** 1-2 weeks typical

**License Status During Grace Period:** VALID (physician may continue to practice)

### TIER 2: Lapsed More Than 60 Days But Less Than 5 Years

[FACT - BOARD] **Reinstatement Type:** Formal Reinstatement Application

**Requirements:**
- Submit formal reinstatement application
- Demonstrate CME compliance for lapsed period
- Background check may be required (Board discretion)
- Re-examination may be required (Board discretion)
- Board review and approval required

**Process:**

2. Include CME documentation for lapsed period
3. Explanation for lapse
4. Current practice status
5. Any other required documentation
6. Board review
7. Board approves, denies, or approves with restrictions

**Timeline:** 4-8 weeks typical (longer if Board hearing required)

**Fees:** Reinstatement fee (amount not specified) + renewal fee

### TIER 3: Lapsed More Than 5 Years

[FACT - BOARD] **Reinstatement Type:** New Application (Full Reapplication)

**Requirements:**
- Treated as new initial licensure applicant
- Background check REQUIRED
- Re-examination REQUIRED
- All original licensure requirements must be met again
- Full credentialing and verification packages required

**Process:**
1. Submit new application for licensure
2. Provide all documents required for initial licensure
3. Pass required examinations per current standards
4. Background check conducted
5. Board review and approval

**Timeline:** 12-20 weeks typical (similar to initial licensure)

**Fees:** Full application and licensing fees (same as new applicant)

[CRITICAL GAP] The exact lapse duration thresholds for each tier (60 days, 5 years, etc.) require verification from statute or board guidance.

**Verification Needed:** Contact PA Board of Medicine to confirm lapse duration categories and reinstatement procedures.

## 10. CME Tracking Systems

### Official CME Tracking System

[FACT - BOARD] Pennsylvania does not operate a state-owned CME tracking system. Physicians are responsible for tracking their own CME completion.

**Recommended Tracking Options:**
1. **CE Broker** (private vendor, optional)
2. **Professional association tracking** (AMA PRA, AOA CME tracking)
3. **Personal records** (spreadsheets, file folders)

### Pennsylvania Licensing System (PALS)

[FACT - BOARD] Pennsylvania uses the **Pennsylvania Licensing System (PALS)** for online license renewal.

**PALS Features:**
- URL: https://www.pals.pa.gov/
- Online renewal application
- CME attestation (no upload required unless audited)
- Fee payment (credit card, debit card)
- License status verification
- Contact information updates

**PALS Renewal Process:**
1. Create or login to PALS account
2. Select "Renew License"
3. Update contact information and practice information
4. Answer attestation questions (including CME compliance)
5. Pay renewal fee
6. Submit application
7. Receive confirmation email
8. License status updated within 24-48 hours

### CE Broker Integration (Optional)

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] While Pennsylvania does not mandate CE Broker usage, many physicians use CE Broker for voluntary CME tracking due to its integration with other states and professional associations.

**CE Broker Features:**
- Course search by state, topic, provider
- Automatic import of "Take it Here" courses from ACCME providers
- Manual entry for completed courses
- CME transcript generation
- Mobile app tracking

**Cost:** CE Broker requires paid subscription (not free for Pennsylvania physicians)

### CME Certificate Management

[FACT - ADMIN_CODE] Physicians must retain CME certificates for audit verification purposes.

**Required Information on Certificates:**
- Course title
- Provider name and accreditation
- Number of Category 1 or Category 2 hours
- Date of completion
- Physician name

[HIGH GAP] How long physicians must retain CME certificates is not specified (see Section 6: Audit & Verification).

---

## 11. State-Specific Requirements

### High Total CME Hours (100 Hours Biennial)

[FACT - ADMIN_CODE] Pennsylvania requires **100 hours every 2 years**, which is higher than most states.

**State Comparison:**
- National average: 40-60 hours biennial
- Pennsylvania: 100 hours biennial (significantly higher)
- Only a few states (e.g., Nevada DO, New Jersey) require similar or higher totals

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] Pennsylvania's high CME burden reflects the state's emphasis on physician continuing education and patient safety.

### Birthday-Based Renewal

[FACT - BOARD] Pennsylvania medical licenses are renewed on the **licensee's birth month and day**, not on a fixed annual date.

**Implications:**
- 365 different renewal dates across the physician population
- Requires individualized tracking (not uniform renewal period)
- Renewal notices sent 60 days before individual birth dates

**Comparison with Other States:**
- Most states: Fixed renewal dates (e.g., June 30, December 31)
- Pennsylvania: Individualized birth-date renewal (adds administrative complexity)

### 60-Day Valid Grace Period

[FACT - BOARD] Pennsylvania provides a **60-day grace period** after license expiration during which the license remains **VALID** and the physician may continue to practice.

**Comparison with Other States:**
- Many states: Grace period exists but license is INACTIVE (cannot practice)
- Pennsylvania: Grace period with VALID license (can practice with late fee)

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] Pennsylvania's valid grace period is physician-friendly, allowing continued practice during late renewal processing.

### Risk Management Emphasis (12 Hours)

[FACT - ADMIN_CODE] Pennsylvania requires **12 hours of risk management and patient safety CME**, which is among the highest mandatory topic requirements nationally.

**State Comparison:**
- Most states: 0-2 hours risk management
- Pennsylvania: 12 hours risk management (biennial)
- Reflects Pennsylvania's focus on malpractice prevention and patient safety

### Child Abuse Mandatory Training

[FACT - ADMIN_CODE] Pennsylvania is one of few states requiring **child abuse recognition and reporting CME** as a mandatory topic.

**Background:**
- Regulation effective July 1, 2015 (following Penn State scandal)
- Reflects Pennsylvania's commitment to child protection
- 2 hours one-time, then 2 hours every 5 years

### Split-Board Structure (MD vs DO)

[FACT - STATUTE] Pennsylvania maintains completely separate MD and DO boards with similar but distinct requirements.

**Key Similarities:**
- Both: 100 hours biennial
- Both: 12 hours risk management
- Both: 2 hours child abuse
- Both: 2 hours opioid/pain management
- Both: 2 hours addiction medicine

**Key Differences:**
- MD: Minimum 20 hours AMA Category 1
- DO: Minimum 20 hours AOA Category 1-A
- Different statutory authorities
- Different board websites and contact information

### Key Findings

**Similarities:**
- Both boards require identical total CME hours (100 biennial)
- Both require identical mandatory topic hours (12 risk mgmt, 2 child abuse, 2 opioid, 2 addiction)
- Both use PALS for online renewal
- Both have 60-day valid grace period
- Both renew on birth month/day

**Differences:**
- **Category 1 Specification:** MD requires AMA Cat 1; DO requires AOA Cat 1-A
- **Statutory Authority:** Completely separate statutory frameworks
- **Board Structure:** Separate boards, separate board members, separate meetings

**TIER 2 Classification Rationale:**
- Split-board structure with separate statutory authorities
- High total CME hours (100 biennial) exceed typical states
- Multiple mandatory topics create compliance complexity
- Similar requirements reduce differentiation complexity compared to dramatically different split-board states (e.g., Oklahoma)

---

## Conclusion

Pennsylvania's MD license renewal requirements are **TIER 2** due to split-board complexity and high total CME hours with multiple mandatory topics. The Pennsylvania State Board of Medicine requires:

- **100 hours CME every 2 years** (biennial renewal)
  - Minimum 20 hours AMA Category 1 or AOA Category 1
  - Remaining 80 hours may be Category 1 or Category 2
- **Mandatory topics:**
  - Risk management/patient safety: 12 hours (biennial)
  - Child abuse recognition: 2 hours (one-time + every 5 years)
  - Pain management/opioid: 2 hours (initial + biennial)
  - Addiction medicine: 2 hours (biennial, may overlap with opioid)
- **Renewal cycle:** Biennial (every 2 years) on birth month/day
- **Grace period:** 60-day valid grace period (can practice with late fee)
- **Tracking:** Personal tracking (no state system); PALS attestation-based renewal

**For Physician Compliance:**
1. Track CME within 24 months preceding renewal date
2. Ensure 20 hours minimum Category 1; remainder Cat 1 or Cat 2
3. Complete 12 hours risk management per cycle
4. Complete 2 hours child abuse (one-time, then every 5 years)
5. Complete 2 hours opioid/pain management per cycle
6. Complete 2 hours addiction medicine per cycle (may overlap with opioid)
7. Renew through PALS 60 days before expiration
8. Retain CME certificates for audit (recommended 5+ years)

**For Rules Engine Implementation:**
- TIER 2 complexity due to split-board structure and high total hours
- High total hours (100) with mixed categories (20 Cat 1, 80 Cat 1/2)
- Multiple mandatory topics with different frequencies (biennial, 5-year, initial)
- Birthday-based renewal creates 365 different renewal dates
- Valid grace period (not inactive) requires special handling
- Contact PA Board of Medicine at (717) 783-1400 to resolve high-priority gaps before deployment
