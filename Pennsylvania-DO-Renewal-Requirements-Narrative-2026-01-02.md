**Source:**
- https://www.pa.gov/en/agencies/dos/department-and-offices/bpoa/boards-commissions/osteopathic-medicine.html

### Statutory Authority

**[FACT - STATUTE]** The Pennsylvania State Board of Osteopathic Medicine operates under the authority of the **Osteopathic Medical Practice Act**, 63 P.S. § 271.1 et seq.

**[FACT - ADMIN_CODE]** CME requirements are codified in **49 Pa. Code Chapter 25**, specifically:
- § 25.271: Requirements for renewal
- § 25.272: Continuing medical education requirements
- § 25.273: Child abuse recognition and reporting
- § 25.231: Schedule of fees

**Source:**
- https://www.pacodeandbulletin.gov/Display/pacode?file=/secure/pacode/data/049/chapter25/chap25toc.html

### Split-Board Context

**[FACT - STATE STRUCTURE]** Pennsylvania maintains **separate regulatory boards** for MD and DO physicians:
- **Pennsylvania State Board of Medicine (PA-M):** Regulates allopathic physicians (MDs)
- **Pennsylvania State Board of Osteopathic Medicine (PA-O):** Regulates osteopathic physicians (DOs)

**[FACT - COMPARISON]** Both boards require 100 hours biennial CME but with different category specifications:
- **DO:** 20 hours AOA Category 1-A minimum (osteopathic-focused)
- **MD:** 20 hours AMA Category 1 minimum

**Source:** Cross-referenced with Pennsylvania-MD-Renewal-Requirements-Narrative-2026-01-02.md

---

## 2. CME REQUIREMENT - TOTAL HOURS & CYCLE

### Total Hour Requirement

**[FACT - ADMIN_CODE]** Pennsylvania-licensed osteopathic physicians must complete **100 credit hours of continuing medical education** in the **preceding biennial period** (2-year cycle).

**Citation:** 49 Pa. Code § 25.272

**Source:**
- https://content.cmepassport.org/staterequirement/pennsylvania-state-board-of-osteopathic-medicine-do/
- https://www.pa.gov/en/agencies/dos/department-and-offices/bpoa/boards-commissions/osteopathic-medicine/renewal-information.html
- https://www.mainlinehealth.org/cme

**[FACT - BOARD]** The CME reporting period for osteopathic physicians runs from **November 1 of an even year through October 31 of the next even year**.

**Example:** For renewal due October 31, 2026:
- CME period: November 1, 2024 – October 31, 2026

**Source:** https://www.pa.gov/en/agencies/dos/department-and-offices/bpoa/boards-commissions/osteopathic-medicine/renewal-information.html

### Category Requirements

**[FACT - ADMIN_CODE]** Of the 100 total hours:
- **Minimum 20 hours** must be **AOA Category 1-A** (osteopathic-focused education)
- **Remaining 80 hours** may be **AMA PRA Category 1 Credit™** or **AOA Category 2**

**Citation:** 49 Pa. Code § 25.272

**Source:**
- https://content.cmepassport.org/staterequirement/pennsylvania-state-board-of-osteopathic-medicine-do/
- https://www.mainlinehealth.org/cme

**AOA Category Definitions:**

**AOA Category 1-A:**
- Formal osteopathic education programs sponsored by recognized osteopathic institutions
- Must include osteopathic principles, osteopathic manipulative treatment (OMT), or osteopathic-focused content
- Accredited by American Osteopathic Association (AOA)

**AMA PRA Category 1 Credit:**
- Formal continuing medical education accredited by Accreditation Council for Continuing Medical Education (ACCME)
- May not have osteopathic-specific content
- Accepted for the 80-hour flexible portion

**AOA Category 2:**
- Informal CME activities (journal reading, self-study, teaching, etc.)
- Accepted for the 80-hour flexible portion

**[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE]** The 20-hour AOA Category 1-A minimum ensures DO physicians maintain competency in osteopathic principles and manipulative treatment, distinguishing DO practice from MD practice. This is the primary difference between Pennsylvania's MD and DO CME requirements.

---

## 3. MANDATORY CME TOPICS WITH HOURS & FREQUENCY

### Topic 1: Risk Management and Patient Safety (12 Hours Biennial)

**[FACT - ADMIN_CODE]** A minimum of **12 hours** of the 100-hour requirement must be **Category 1 or Category 2 activities** on the subject of **patient safety and risk management**.

**Citation:** 49 Pa. Code § 25.272 (incorporating provisions similar to MD board's § 16.18)

**Source:**
- https://www.mainlinehealth.org/cme
- https://content.cmepassport.org/staterequirement/pennsylvania-state-board-of-osteopathic-medicine-do/

**Frequency:** Every biennial renewal cycle (every 2 years)

**Acceptable Topics:** Physicians may self-determine which activities meet the risk management criterion, including:
- Morbidity and mortality conferences
- Patient safety quality improvement initiatives
- Medical error prevention training
- Adverse event analysis and prevention
- Communication skills training
- Systems-based practice improvements

**[FACT - BOARD]** The 12 hours may be counted toward either the Category 1 or Category 2 portion of the 100-hour requirement, providing flexibility in how physicians satisfy this mandate.

**[INFERENCE - MEDIUM]** Unlike some states, Pennsylvania allows risk management CME to be informal (Category 2), recognizing that practice-based activities like M&M conferences constitute valid risk management education.

### Topic 2: Child Abuse Recognition and Reporting (2 Hours)

**[FACT - STATUTE]** In accordance with **Act 31 of 2014**, osteopathic physicians must complete **2 hours of approved child abuse recognition and reporting training** for license renewal.

**Citation:** 49 Pa. Code § 25.273; Act 31 of 2014

**Source:**
- https://www.mainlinehealth.org/cme
- https://content.cmepassport.org/staterequirement/pennsylvania-state-board-of-osteopathic-medicine-do/

**Frequency Structure:**
- **First renewal (one-time):** 2 hours required
- **Subsequent renewals:** 2 hours required **every 5 years**

**[FACT - ADMIN_CODE]** The child abuse recognition CME must be completed through **state-approved programs** designated by the Board.

**[CRITICAL GAP]** The specific timing mechanism for the "every 5 years" requirement is not clearly documented (e.g., whether physicians renewing in 2026 who completed child abuse CME in 2024 need it again in 2029 or 2031). Board clarification needed.

**[INFERENCE - MEDIUM]** Based on cross-reference with MD board requirements (same Act 31 statute), the 5-year cycle likely runs from the date of completion, not the renewal cycle. Physicians should track completion date independently.

### Topic 3: Pain Management, Addiction, and Opioid Prescribing (2 Hours)

**[FACT - STATUTE]** Osteopathic physicians must complete **2 hours of CME** on **pain management, identification of addiction, or practices of prescribing or dispensing opioids**.

**Source:**
- https://content.cmepassport.org/staterequirement/pennsylvania-state-board-of-osteopathic-medicine-do/
- https://www.mainlinehealth.org/cme

**Frequency Structure:**
- **Initial licensure:** 2 hours required **within 12 months** of receiving unrestricted license
- **Subsequent renewals:** 2 hours required **per biennial renewal cycle**

**Acceptable Content:**
- Pain management techniques and assessment
- Identification and treatment of addiction
- Opioid prescribing best practices
- CDC Opioid Prescribing Guidelines
- Pennsylvania PDMP (Prescription Drug Monitoring Program) usage
- Risks of opioid dependence and overdose

**[FACT - BOARD]** The 2-hour requirement may include content on any combination of the three topics (pain management, addiction identification, opioid prescribing practices).

**[INFERENCE - HIGH]** Pennsylvania allows flexibility in how physicians satisfy this requirement - a single 2-hour course covering all three topics, or separate courses on each, both satisfy the mandate.

**[COMPARISON WITH MD BOARD]** The MD board has identical requirements (2 hrs within 12 months, then 2 hrs per renewal), suggesting this is a statewide opioid education policy applying to both MD and DO physicians equally.

---

## 4. RENEWAL CYCLE & DEADLINES

### Biennial Renewal Structure

**[FACT - BOARD]** Osteopathic physician licenses in Pennsylvania renew **biennially** (every 2 years) with a **fixed deadline of October 31** in **even-numbered years**.

**Renewal Years:** 2024, 2026, 2028, 2030, etc. (all even years)

**Source:**
- https://www.pa.gov/en/agencies/dos/department-and-offices/bpoa/boards-commissions/osteopathic-medicine/renewal-information.html
- https://content.cmepassport.org/staterequirement/pennsylvania-state-board-of-osteopathic-medicine-do/

**Current Renewal Cycle:**
- **CME Period:** November 1, 2024 – October 31, 2026
- **Renewal Deadline:** October 31, 2026

**Next Renewal Cycle:**
- **CME Period:** November 1, 2026 – October 31, 2028
- **Renewal Deadline:** October 31, 2028

**[COMPARISON WITH MD BOARD]** DO physicians renew on a **fixed date (October 31)**, while MD physicians renew on their **birth month/day** biennially. This is a material difference in renewal administration between the two boards.

### Advance Renewal Notices

**[FACT - BOARD]** The Pennsylvania State Board of Osteopathic Medicine mails **renewal notices 2 to 3 months prior to the license expiration date** (typically August-September for October 31 deadline).

**Source:** https://www.pa.gov/en/agencies/dos/department-and-offices/bpoa/boards-commissions/osteopathic-medicine/renewal-information.html

**[IMPORTANT]** The board notes that **postal forwarding is not guaranteed** for license materials. Physicians must update their address in PALS to ensure receipt of renewal notices.

### Grace Period & Late Renewal

**[CRITICAL GAP - HIGH PRIORITY]** The grace period policy for osteopathic physician renewals is **not clearly documented** in current accessible materials.

**Historical Context:**
**[FACT - HISTORICAL]** In 2022, the State Board of Osteopathic Medicine extended the deadline to renew a DO license from October 31 to November 30, providing a one-month extension.

**Source:** https://www.poma.org/pa-license-renewal (via search results, dated 2022)

**[CRITICAL QUESTION]** Is this November 30 extension:
1. A permanent grace period policy (October 31 expiration with November 30 grace period)?
2. A one-time pandemic-era accommodation no longer in effect?
3. A policy that varies by renewal cycle?

**[COMPARISON WITH MD BOARD]** The MD board provides a **60-day grace period** after expiration during which the license remains valid. Whether DO physicians have a similar grace period is not confirmed in accessible materials.

**Recommendation:** Contact Pennsylvania State Board of Osteopathic Medicine at (717) 783-4858 to clarify current grace period policy.

### Late Renewal Penalties

**[FACT - ADMIN_CODE]** A **penalty fee** as specified by 49 Pa. Code § 25.231 will be imposed on a licensee who **continued to practice without having timely renewed their license**.

**Source:**
- https://www.pacodeandbulletin.gov/Display/pacode?file=/secure/pacode/data/049/chapter25/s25.271.html
- Search results referencing § 25.271

**[CRITICAL GAP]** The exact penalty fee amount is not specified in accessible online materials. 49 Pa. Code § 25.231 (Schedule of Fees) requires direct regulatory code access to determine penalty amounts.

**[INFERENCE - MEDIUM]** Based on standard Pennsylvania licensing board practices, late renewal penalties typically range from $50-$150, but this is not confirmed for osteopathic physicians specifically.

---

## 5. RENEWAL FEES & PAYMENTS

### Biennial Renewal Fee

**[FACT - ADMIN_CODE]** The **biennial renewal fee** for an active osteopathic physician license is **$450**.

**Citation:** 49 Pa. Code § 25.231 (Schedule of fees)

**Source:**
- https://www.pa.gov/en/agencies/dos/department-and-offices/bpoa/boards-commissions/osteopathic-medicine/renewal-information.html
- https://www.pacodeandbulletin.gov/Display/pacode?file=/secure/pacode/data/049/chapter25/s25.231.html
- https://www.porh.psu.edu/pennsylvania-board-of-osteopathic-medicine-increases-renewal-fees/

**[FACT - HISTORICAL]** This fee represents an increase from previous renewal amounts, implemented by the Board in recent years.

**[COMPARISON WITH MD BOARD]** The MD board renewal fee is **not publicly documented** in accessible materials, but both boards operate under Pennsylvania Department of State fee structures which may differ between medical and osteopathic boards.

### PALS Online Renewal System

**[FACT - BOARD]** Pennsylvania uses the **Pennsylvania Licensing System (PALS)** for online license renewal at **www.pals.pa.gov**.

**Source:**
- https://www.pals.pa.gov/
- https://www.pa.gov/en/agencies/dos/department-and-offices/bpoa/boards-commissions/osteopathic-medicine/renewal-information.html

**PALS System Features:**
- Online license renewal
- CME documentation upload
- License verification
- Address updates
- Application status tracking
- Fee payment (credit/debit card, electronic check)

**[FACT - BOARD]** Physicians can renew their license, update contact information, and track the status of applications through the PALS portal.

**[INFERENCE - HIGH]** PALS integration streamlines the renewal process and creates a centralized digital record of licensure and CME compliance, similar to California's BreEZe system.

### CME Documentation Submission

**[FACT - BOARD]** Renewal applicants must submit **proof of continuing education completed during the preceding two-year period**.

**Source:** https://www.pa.gov/en/agencies/dos/department-and-offices/bpoa/boards-commissions/osteopathic-medicine/renewal-information.html

**[FACT - BOARD]** Required forms and CME documentation are available as **downloadable PDFs** on the renewal information page, including an **opioid education verification form**.

**[CRITICAL GAP]** The specific format requirements for CME certificates (e.g., must include provider name, accreditation statement, hours, date, etc.) are not documented in accessible materials.

**[INFERENCE - MEDIUM]** CME certificates should likely include:
- Licensee name
- Course title and description
- Provider name and accreditation body
- Number of credit hours
- Date of completion
- Signature or verification from provider

Physicians should retain detailed CME certificates to satisfy audit requirements.

---

## 6. CME TRACKING & AUDIT PROCEDURES

### CME Reporting via PALS

**[FACT - BOARD]** Physicians report CME compliance through the **PALS (Pennsylvania Licensing System)** online portal during the renewal process.

**Source:** https://www.pals.pa.gov/

**[CRITICAL GAP]** Detailed audit procedures, including:
- Audit frequency (annual, biennial, percentage of licensees audited)
- Audit selection criteria (random, risk-based, complaint-driven)
- Response timeline after audit notification
- Penalties for audit non-compliance (beyond general disciplinary authority)
- Documentation submission requirements during audit

...are not documented in accessible online materials.

**[INFERENCE - LOW]** Based on standard medical board practices, Pennsylvania likely conducts:
- Random post-renewal audits of a percentage of licensees
- Risk-based audits for physicians with prior non-compliance
- Complaint-driven audits when CME fraud is suspected

However, without official documentation, these are assumptions.

### Documentation Retention

**[CRITICAL GAP - HIGH PRIORITY]** The Pennsylvania State Board of Osteopathic Medicine does not specify in accessible materials how long physicians must **retain CME certificates and documentation**.

**[COMPARISON WITH OTHER STATES]** Common retention periods:
- California: 4 years
- Texas: 4 years
- Most states: 4-6 years

**Recommendation:** Physicians should retain CME documentation for a minimum of **4 years** (covering 2 biennial renewal cycles) to ensure compliance with potential audits. Contact the Board at (717) 783-4858 to confirm the official retention requirement.

### Opioid Education Verification Form

**[FACT - BOARD]** The Board provides a specific **opioid education verification form** that must be submitted with renewal applications to document compliance with the 2-hour pain management/opioid prescribing CME requirement.

**Source:** https://www.pa.gov/en/agencies/dos/department-and-offices/bpoa/boards-commissions/osteopathic-medicine/renewal-information.html

**[INFERENCE - HIGH]** This separate verification form suggests the Board prioritizes opioid CME compliance tracking, likely due to the opioid epidemic and state-level monitoring requirements.

---

## 7. CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE PRESCRIBING CONTEXT

### Pennsylvania PDMP (Prescription Drug Monitoring Program)

**[FACT - STATE LAW]** Pennsylvania operates a **Prescription Drug Monitoring Program (PDMP)** that tracks controlled substance prescriptions statewide.

**[FACT - REQUIREMENT]** Physicians who prescribe controlled substances must register with and use the PDMP to check patient prescription histories before prescribing certain medications.

**Source:** Pennsylvania Department of Health PDMP resources (general context)

**[INFERENCE - HIGH]** The 2-hour opioid prescribing CME requirement likely includes instruction on PDMP usage, safe prescribing practices, and identification of potential drug-seeking behavior or opioid misuse.

### Federal DEA Registration

**[FACT - FEDERAL]** Physicians who prescribe controlled substances must maintain a separate **Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) registration**, which operates on a **3-year federal renewal cycle** independent of Pennsylvania state licensure.

**[FACT - FEDERAL]** DEA registration fees and renewal are separate from Pennsylvania state license fees and are not collected by the Pennsylvania State Board of Osteopathic Medicine.

### MATE Act Training Requirement (Federal)

**[FACT - FEDERAL]** The **Medication Access and Training Expansion (MATE) Act**, effective June 27, 2023, requires physicians with DEA registrations who are authorized to prescribe controlled substances in schedules III, IV, or V to complete **8 hours of training on treating and managing patients with opioid or other substance use disorders**.

**Source:** Federal MATE Act, Public Law 117-215

**[FACT - FEDERAL]** This is a **one-time federal requirement** separate from Pennsylvania's state CME requirements.

**[INFERENCE - HIGH]** Pennsylvania osteopathic physicians who complete the 2-hour biennial pain management/opioid CME plus additional addiction medicine training will likely accumulate 8+ hours over multiple cycles, potentially satisfying the federal MATE Act requirement. However, physicians should verify that chosen CME programs explicitly state MATE Act compliance.

**[CRITICAL GAP]** Pennsylvania's Board website does not clarify whether the state's 2-hour opioid CME requirement integrates with or is separate from the federal 8-hour MATE Act requirement. Physicians should track both requirements independently.

---

## 8. EXEMPTIONS & SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES

### Residency/Fellowship Training

**[CRITICAL GAP]** The Pennsylvania State Board of Osteopathic Medicine website does not document:
- Whether resident physicians are exempt from CME requirements during training
- Whether newly licensed physicians completing residency have reduced CME requirements for first renewal
- Whether program director certification is required for exemption

**[COMPARISON WITH MD BOARD]** Many states exempt residents and fellows from CME requirements during active training, recognizing that residency/fellowship constitutes ongoing medical education. Whether Pennsylvania DO board has this exemption is not confirmed.

### Board Certification Exemptions

**[CRITICAL GAP - HIGH PRIORITY]** The Board website does not document whether **osteopathic board certification** (e.g., AOA-BOS certification or Maintenance of Certification) provides:
- Full or partial exemption from the 100-hour CME requirement
- CME credit toward the 100-hour requirement
- Exemption from CME audits
- Any other benefits

**[COMPARISON WITH OTHER STATES]**
- Some states credit 50-100 hours for active board certification
- Some states exempt board-certified physicians from audits
- Some states provide no board certification benefits

**Recommendation:** Board-certified osteopathic physicians should contact the Board at (717) 783-4858 to clarify whether AOA-BOS certification or MOC provides CME benefits in Pennsylvania.

### Inactive License Status

**[CRITICAL GAP]** The Board website does not clearly document:
- Whether inactive license status is available for Pennsylvania DO licenses
- Whether inactive licensees are exempt from CME requirements
- Requirements for reactivating an inactive license (e.g., CME hours needed, fees, processing time)

### Military Service

**[CRITICAL GAP]** No documentation found regarding:
- Whether active duty military physicians are exempt from CME requirements during deployment
- Whether military physicians have extended renewal timelines
- Whether military CME (completed through DoD/VA systems) counts toward Pennsylvania requirements
- Whether spouses of military members receive licensing accommodations

### Hardship Waivers

**[CRITICAL GAP]** The Board website does not document:
- Criteria for hardship waivers or CME requirement reductions
- Application procedures for medical disability affecting ability to complete CME
- Emergency or disaster-related extensions (e.g., pandemic, natural disaster)

**[INFERENCE - LOW]** The Board likely has statutory authority to grant waivers in extraordinary circumstances, but criteria and procedures are not published in accessible format.

---

## 9. LAPSED LICENSE & REINSTATEMENT PROCEDURES

### Late Renewal vs. Lapsed License

**[FACT - ADMIN_CODE]** Physicians who continue to practice medicine without timely renewing their license are subject to **penalty fees** and potential disciplinary action.

**Citation:** 49 Pa. Code § 25.271

**Source:** https://www.pacodeandbulletin.gov/Display/pacode?file=/secure/pacode/data/049/chapter25/s25.271.html

**[CRITICAL GAP]** The Board website does not clearly distinguish between:
- **Late renewal** (renewal submitted after October 31 but before license formally lapses)
- **Lapsed license** (license expired for extended period, cannot be renewed - must be reinstated)

### Reinstatement Procedures

**[CRITICAL GAP - HIGH PRIORITY]** The Pennsylvania State Board of Osteopathic Medicine website does not document:
- The timeline after which a delinquent license becomes "lapsed" and requires reinstatement (vs. late renewal)
- Reinstatement application procedures
- Reinstatement fees (separate from renewal fees)
- CME requirements for reinstatement (catch-up hours for lapsed period?)
- Whether physicians must retake exams after extended lapse
- Processing time for reinstatement applications

**[COMPARISON WITH MD BOARD]** The MD board likely has documented reinstatement procedures, but whether DO board procedures are identical is not confirmed.

**Recommendation:** Physicians with lapsed licenses should contact the Board at (717) 783-4858 immediately to clarify reinstatement requirements and avoid extended practice prohibition.

## 10. NEW LICENSEE & PRO-RATA CME REQUIREMENTS

### Initial Licensing CME Timeline

**[FACT - STATUTE]** Newly licensed osteopathic physicians must complete **2 hours of pain management/opioid prescribing CME within 12 months** of receiving an unrestricted license.

**Source:** Pennsylvania opioid education requirements (referenced in search results)

**[CRITICAL GAP]** The Board website does not specify:
- Whether the full 100-hour CME requirement applies to physicians licensed for less than the full 2-year renewal cycle before first renewal
- Whether CME hours are prorated based on licensure date (e.g., licensed 1 year before renewal = 50 hours required)
- Whether first-time renewals are exempt from CME (as in some states)

**[INFERENCE - MEDIUM]** Based on the fixed biennial cycle (Nov 1 even year – Oct 31 next even year), physicians licensed mid-cycle likely must complete CME proportional to the time licensed. However, this is not confirmed.

**Example Scenario:**
- Physician licensed: March 1, 2025
- First renewal due: October 31, 2026
- Time licensed before first renewal: 20 months (out of 24-month cycle)
- Estimated CME required: 83 hours? (20/24 × 100)

**Recommendation:** Newly licensed osteopathic physicians should contact the Board at (717) 783-4858 to clarify CME requirements for first renewal cycle.

### Child Abuse CME for New Licensees

**[FACT - STATUTE]** Act 31 of 2014 requires child abuse recognition training for license renewal, with the first 2 hours required at the first renewal.

**[INFERENCE - HIGH]** Newly licensed osteopathic physicians will need to complete the 2-hour child abuse recognition CME before their first renewal (by October 31 of the next even year after licensure).

---

## 11. STATE-SPECIFIC CME FEATURES & DISTINCTIONS

### Act 31 Child Abuse Mandate (Pennsylvania-Specific)

**[FACT - STATE LAW]** Pennsylvania's **Act 31 of 2014** mandates child abuse recognition and reporting training for all licensed professionals who work with children, including physicians.

**[FACT - ADMIN_CODE]** The 2-hour child abuse recognition CME must be completed through **state-approved programs** designated by the Board.

**Source:** 49 Pa. Code § 25.273; Act 31 of 2014

**[INFERENCE - HIGH]** This is a Pennsylvania-specific requirement not found in most other states, reflecting state-level policy prioritization of child abuse prevention and reporting.

### Risk Management Self-Determination (Pennsylvania-Specific)

**[FACT - BOARD]** Pennsylvania allows physicians to **self-determine** which activities meet the 12-hour risk management/patient safety requirement.

**Source:** https://www.mainlinehealth.org/cme

**[INFERENCE - MEDIUM]** This flexible approach contrasts with some states that mandate specific risk management topics or approve only certain providers. Pennsylvania trusts physicians to select relevant risk management education.

**Examples of Acceptable Activities:**
- Morbidity and mortality conferences
- Hospital quality improvement committees
- Patient safety rounds
- Medical error root cause analysis
- Communication skills workshops
- Systems-based practice training

### PALS Integration (Pennsylvania-Specific)

**[FACT - BOARD]** Pennsylvania's **Pennsylvania Licensing System (PALS)** is the state's integrated online licensing portal for all Department of State professional licenses.

**Source:** https://www.pals.pa.gov/

**[INFERENCE - HIGH]** PALS integration creates efficiency and centralization similar to California's BreEZe system, streamlining renewals across multiple Pennsylvania-regulated professions (not just medicine).

## 14. CRITICAL GAPS & LIMITATIONS

### Critical Gaps Identified During Research

**[CRITICAL GAP #1] Grace Period Policy**
- **What's Missing:** Whether Pennsylvania DO licenses have a grace period after October 31, and if so, how long (historical November 30 extension documented for 2022 but current policy unclear)
- **Why It Matters:** Physicians need to know if they can practice legally after October 31 if renewal is pending
- **Search Attempts:** Searched board website, renewal information page, Pennsylvania Code summaries - no current policy found
- **Impact:** HIGH - affects late renewal planning and legal practice authority
- **Recommendation:** Contact Board at (717) 783-4858 to clarify current grace period policy

**[CRITICAL GAP #2] Exact Late Renewal Penalty Fee Amount**
- **What's Missing:** The specific dollar amount of the penalty fee for late renewal
- **Why It Matters:** Physicians need to budget for late renewal costs
- **Search Attempts:** Searched § 25.231 fee schedule - full code not accessible online
- **Impact:** MEDIUM - affects financial planning for late renewal
- **Recommendation:** Access full 49 Pa. Code § 25.231 or contact Board

**[CRITICAL GAP #3] Board Certification Exemption Policy**
- **What's Missing:** Whether AOA-BOS board certification or Maintenance of Certification provides CME credit, audit exemption, or other benefits
- **Why It Matters:** Board-certified DOs need to know if certification reduces CME burden
- **Search Attempts:** Searched board website, Pennsylvania Code summaries, professional association guidance - no documentation found
- **Impact:** HIGH for board-certified physicians - could significantly reduce compliance burden
- **Recommendation:** Contact Board at (717) 783-4858

**[CRITICAL GAP #4] CME Audit Procedures**
- **What's Missing:** Audit frequency, selection criteria, response timeline, penalties for non-compliance
- **Why It Matters:** Physicians need to understand audit risk and compliance obligations
- **Search Attempts:** Searched board website, administrative code - no detailed procedures found
- **Impact:** MEDIUM - affects compliance preparation and documentation practices
- **Recommendation:** Contact Board for audit details

**[CRITICAL GAP #5] CME Documentation Retention Period**
- **What's Missing:** How long physicians must retain CME certificates
- **Why It Matters:** Physicians need to know retention requirements to avoid audit non-compliance
- **Search Attempts:** Searched board website, renewal information - not specified
- **Impact:** MEDIUM - risk of audit failure if documentation discarded too early
- **Recommendation:** Assume 4 years minimum (standard practice) and contact Board to confirm

**[CRITICAL GAP #6] Child Abuse CME 5-Year Cycle Mechanics**
- **What's Missing:** How the "every 5 years" requirement is tracked (from first completion date vs. fixed 5-year intervals)
- **Why It Matters:** Physicians need to know when the 2-hour requirement recurs
- **Search Attempts:** Searched Act 31 implementation, board guidance - mechanics not detailed
- **Impact:** MEDIUM - affects long-term CME planning
- **Recommendation:** Track from initial completion date and contact Board to confirm

**[CRITICAL GAP #7] New Licensee Pro-Rata CME**
- **What's Missing:** Whether newly licensed physicians have reduced CME requirements for first renewal cycle based on licensure date
- **Why It Matters:** New physicians need to know compliance requirements before first renewal
- **Search Attempts:** Searched board website, renewal information - not documented
- **Impact:** HIGH for new licensees - could require significant CME completion in short timeframe
- **Recommendation:** Contact Board at (717) 783-4858 before first renewal

**[CRITICAL GAP #8] Lapsed License Reinstatement Procedures**
- **What's Missing:** Timeline distinguishing late renewal from lapsed license; reinstatement application procedures, fees, CME requirements
- **Why It Matters:** Physicians with expired licenses need to know reinstatement pathway
- **Search Attempts:** Searched board website, Pennsylvania Code - not documented
- **Impact:** HIGH when applicable (low frequency but critical for affected physicians)
- **Recommendation:** Contact Board immediately if license has lapsed

**[CRITICAL GAP #9] Military Service Exemptions**
- **What's Missing:** Whether active duty military physicians are exempt from CME during deployment; whether military CME counts toward Pennsylvania requirements
- **Why It Matters:** Military physicians need to know accommodation policies
- **Search Attempts:** Searched board website, Pennsylvania military accommodation laws - no DO-specific information found
- **Impact:** MEDIUM for military physicians
- **Recommendation:** Military physicians should contact Board regarding service accommodations

**[CRITICAL GAP #10] Inactive License Status**
- **What's Missing:** Whether inactive status is available; CME exemptions for inactive licensees; reactivation requirements
- **Why It Matters:** Physicians temporarily not practicing need to know if inactive status is an option
- **Search Attempts:** Searched board website, fee schedule - not documented
- **Impact:** MEDIUM for physicians considering practice interruption
- **Recommendation:** Contact Board regarding inactive license option

### Research Limitations

**Pennsylvania Code Access:** Full Pennsylvania Code (49 Pa. Code Chapter 25) not fully accessible online without legal database subscription. Specific fee amounts, detailed audit procedures, and procedural requirements may be documented in regulations not easily accessible.

**Historical vs. Current Policies:** Some sources (e.g., POMA 2022 grace period extension) reflect historical accommodations that may not be current policy. Ongoing verification needed.

**Comparison Gaps:** MD board documentation also contains similar gaps (fees, audits, board certification), making direct comparison incomplete in several areas.

**Federal vs. State Integration:** Unclear how federal MATE Act 8-hour requirement integrates with Pennsylvania's 2-hour biennial opioid CME. Physicians should track both independently.

### Verification Recommendations

Physicians should contact the Pennsylvania State Board of Osteopathic Medicine at **(717) 783-4858** or email **ST-OSTEOPATHIC@pa.gov** to clarify:
1. Current grace period policy (October 31 deadline vs. November 30 extension)
2. Exact late renewal penalty fee amount (§ 25.231)
3. Board certification exemption or CME credit policies for AOA-BOS certification
4. CME audit frequency, selection, and response procedures
5. CME documentation retention period
6. Child abuse CME 5-year cycle tracking mechanics
7. New licensee pro-rata CME requirements for first renewal
8. Lapsed license reinstatement timeline and procedures
9. Military service CME exemptions or accommodations
10. Inactive license status availability and requirements
