## 1. Board Information & Regulatory Authority

### Official Board Information

[FACT - BOARD] The Virginia Board of Medicine is the official regulatory agency for physicians in Virginia. Website: https://dhp.virginia.gov/medicine/. Phone: (804) 367-4600. (Accessed 2026-01-02)

[FACT - STATUTE] The Virginia Board of Medicine's authority derives from the Virginia Code § 54.1-2900 et seq. (Medicine and Other Health Related Professions) and the Virginia Department of Health Professions regulatory framework.

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] Virginia operates a unified medical board regulating both MD and DO physicians under the same statutory framework and CME requirements.

### Primary Statutory Framework

[FACT - STATUTE] Virginia Code § 54.1-2910.1 establishes the statutory requirement for continuing education for licensure renewal. Source: Va. Code § 54.1-2910.1.

[FACT - ADMIN_CODE] 18 Virginia Administrative Code 85-20-310 provides the detailed regulatory framework for continuing education requirements, including the 60-hour biennial requirement, category breakdown, voluntary service credit, and documentation requirements. Source: 18 VAC 85-20-310.

[FACT - BOARD] Renewal portal: https://www.dhp.virginia.gov/mylicense/ (Virginia Department of Health Professions online licensing)

---

## 2. Renewal Cycle & Dates

### Biennial Renewal Schedule (Every 2 Years)

[FACT - STATUTE] Virginia physicians renew their medical licenses every 2 years (biennial cycle). 18 VAC 85-20-310.

[CRITICAL GAP] The specific renewal deadline dates (birth month, fixed date, license issuance anniversary, etc.) are not documented in the accessible materials reviewed. Physicians should verify their individual renewal date through the Virginia DHP portal or by contacting the board directly.

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] Based on common state practices, Virginia likely uses either a birth month renewal system or a license issuance anniversary system. Individual physicians should confirm their renewal date.

### Renewal Timeline & Submission Windows

[CRITICAL GAP] Renewal submission window timeline (e.g., 60 days prior to expiration, 90 days prior) is not documented in accessible materials. Contact Virginia Board of Medicine at (804) 367-4600 for specific renewal window information.

[CRITICAL GAP] Grace period mechanics and late renewal procedures are not documented in accessible statute or administrative code materials reviewed.

---

## 3. CME Requirements - Base Hours & Categories

### Total CME Hours Required

[FACT - STATUTE] Virginia requires **60 continuing medical education hours every 2 years (biennial renewal cycle)**. Of these 60 hours:
- **Minimum 30 hours must be AMA Category 1 or AOA equivalent**
- **Remaining 30 hours may be Category 1 or Category 2**

18 VAC 85-20-310.

[FACT - FSMB] FSMB State CME Requirements document confirms: "60 hrs/2yr, 30 Category 1. Up to 15 Category 2 hrs from voluntary services to low-income (local health dept or free clinic)." This substantially matches the statutory requirement with additional detail on voluntary service credit.

### Category Requirements Breakdown

[FACT - STATUTE] The 60-hour requirement is structured as follows:
- **30 hours minimum:** AMA Category 1 or AOA Category 1-A equivalent (formal, accredited CME)
- **30 hours:** May be Category 1 or Category 2 (including up to 15 hours from voluntary service credit)

18 VAC 85-20-310.

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] Virginia's mixed category approach provides flexibility. Physicians can complete all 60 hours as Category 1 (formal CME), or they can use up to 30 hours of Category 2 (informal CME such as journal reading, self-study, teaching) to fulfill the requirement.

### Voluntary Service Credit (Up to 15 Category 2 Hours)

[FACT - FSMB] Virginia allows **up to 15 Category 2 hours to be earned from voluntary services to low-income patients at local health departments or free clinics**. FSMB State CME Requirements.

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] The voluntary service credit provision allows physicians to earn Category 2 CME hours by providing pro bono healthcare services to underserved populations through designated clinics and health departments.

**Voluntary Service Credit Structure (Inferred):**
- Physicians provide free healthcare services at local health department or free clinic
- Up to 15 Category 2 CME hours may be claimed for this voluntary service
- These hours count toward the 60-hour biennial requirement (within the 30-hour Category 2 allowance)

[CRITICAL GAP] The conversion rate for voluntary service to CME hours is not documented (e.g., 1 CME hour per X hours of volunteer service, or attestation-based).

[CRITICAL GAP] Specific documentation requirements for voluntary service (e.g., clinic attestation, logs, patient encounter documentation) are not detailed in accessible materials.

[CRITICAL GAP] What qualifies as "voluntary services to low-income patients" and which local health departments or free clinics are approved is not defined in accessible materials.

**Comparison to Utah:** Utah offers 15% credit for volunteer healthcare (1 CME hour per 4 hours documented). Virginia's provision is structured differently, allowing up to 15 Category 2 hours from voluntary service, but the conversion rate is not documented.

## 4. CME Topic Requirements - Mandatory Topics

### Overview of Mandatory Topics

[FACT - FSMB] FSMB State CME Requirements document does not list specific mandatory topics for Virginia beyond the general 60-hour requirement and voluntary service credit provision.

[CRITICAL GAP] Whether Virginia has mandatory CME topics (e.g., opioid prescribing, pain management, cultural competency, end-of-life care) is not documented in the accessible FSMB data or materials reviewed.

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] Based on FSMB data showing no specific mandatory topics listed, Virginia likely has minimal or no topic-specific CME requirements beyond the general 60-hour requirement. However, this should be verified with the Virginia Board of Medicine or through statute review.

### Potential Mandatory Topics (Requiring Verification)

[CRITICAL GAP] Common mandatory topics in other states include:
- Opioid prescribing / pain management
- Prescription Drug Monitoring Program (PDMP) training
- Cultural competency
- End-of-life care / palliative care
- Medical ethics
- Patient safety / risk management

Whether Virginia requires any of these topics is not documented in accessible materials. Physicians should contact the Virginia Board of Medicine to confirm whether any topic-specific requirements exist.

---

## 5. Exemptions & Alternatives

### Board Certification (ABMS/AOA)

[CRITICAL GAP] Whether ABMS board certification or ABMS Maintenance of Certification (MOC) provides any exemption or credit toward the Virginia CME requirement is not documented in accessible materials.

[INFERENCE - LOW CONFIDENCE] Unlike some states (e.g., Texas, Idaho) that provide explicit CME exemptions for board-certified physicians, Virginia does not appear to offer a board certification exemption in the accessible FSMB data. However, board certification activities (MOC) may count toward the 60-hour Category 1 requirement if they are ACCME-accredited.

### Newly Licensed Physicians

[CRITICAL GAP] Whether newly licensed physicians (first-time renewals) receive any exemption, reduction, or pro-rated CME requirement is not documented in accessible materials.

### Military Service & Hardship Exemptions

[CRITICAL GAP] Military service exemptions, hardship exemptions, or other special circumstances (illness, disability, etc.) are not documented in accessible materials.

---

## 6. Audit & Verification Procedures

### CME Documentation Requirements

[FACT - STATUTE] Physicians must maintain documentation of CME completion for audit and verification purposes. 18 VAC 85-20-310.

[CRITICAL GAP] The specific documentation retention period (e.g., 4 years, 6 years, duration of licensure) is not documented in accessible materials.

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] Physicians should retain CME certificates, transcripts, or other proof of completion for at least the duration of the current renewal cycle plus one additional cycle (approximately 4 years) to ensure availability in case of audit.

### Voluntary Service Documentation

[FACT - FSMB] Physicians claiming voluntary service credit must maintain documentation of volunteer service at local health departments or free clinics.

[CRITICAL GAP] The specific documentation requirements for voluntary service (e.g., clinic attestation letter, volunteer logs, supervisor signature, patient encounter logs) are not detailed in accessible materials.

### Audit Procedures

[FACT - STATUTE] The Virginia Board of Medicine conducts random audits of physicians for CME compliance. 18 VAC 85-20-310.

[CRITICAL GAP] The percentage or frequency of audits (e.g., 5% of renewals annually, 10% of renewals) is not published in statute or accessible materials.

[CRITICAL GAP] Audit response timeline (e.g., 30 days to provide documentation, 60 days) is not documented.

[CRITICAL GAP] Consequences of audit non-compliance (fines, license suspension, additional CME requirements) are not detailed in accessible materials.

---

## 7. Renewal Procedures & Fees

### Standard Renewal Process

[FACT - BOARD] Physicians renew through the Virginia Department of Health Professions online portal at: https://www.dhp.virginia.gov/mylicense/

[CRITICAL GAP] Renewal submission window (when renewal opens prior to expiration) is not documented in accessible materials.

### Renewal Fees

[CRITICAL GAP] The specific renewal fee amount is not published in accessible materials reviewed. Physicians should check the renewal portal or contact the Virginia Board of Medicine at (804) 367-4600 for current fee information.

### Grace Period & Late Renewal

[CRITICAL GAP] Grace period mechanics (if any), late renewal procedures, and late fees are not documented in statute or accessible materials.

---

## 8. Lapsed License Reinstatement

### Reinstatement Procedures

[CRITICAL GAP] Lapsed license reinstatement procedures, timelines, and CME requirements for reinstatement are not documented in the materials reviewed.

[INFERENCE - LOW CONFIDENCE] Virginia likely has tiered reinstatement procedures based on length of lapse (e.g., <1 year, 1-3 years, >3 years), similar to other TIER 1 states, but specific requirements are not documented.

---

## 9. Controlled Substance Context

### Opioid Prescribing CME

[CRITICAL GAP] Whether Virginia has a mandatory opioid prescribing or pain management CME requirement is not documented in the accessible FSMB data or materials reviewed.

[INFERENCE - LOW CONFIDENCE] Many states have implemented opioid prescribing CME requirements in response to the opioid crisis. Virginia may have such a requirement, but it is not documented in accessible materials. Physicians should contact the Virginia Board of Medicine to confirm whether opioid CME is required.

### Prescription Drug Monitoring Program (PDMP)

[CRITICAL GAP] Whether Virginia requires PDMP training as part of CME is not documented.

---

## 10. CME Tracking Systems

### CME Tracking & Documentation

[CRITICAL GAP] Whether Virginia uses a centralized CME tracking system (e.g., CE Broker) or relies on physician attestation and audit is not documented in accessible materials.

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] Based on common TIER 1 state practices, Virginia likely uses a physician attestation system where physicians certify CME completion during renewal, with documentation verified only upon audit.

### CME Provider Auto-Reporting

[CRITICAL GAP] Whether CME providers are required to auto-report completion to the Virginia Board of Medicine is not documented.

### Cross-Source Congruency

**Verification Against FSMB Data:**
- FSMB reports: "60 hrs/2yr, 30 Category 1" ✅ **MATCHES statute** (18 VAC 85-20-310)
- FSMB reports: "Up to 15 Category 2 hrs from voluntary services to low-income (local health dept or free clinic)" ✅ **CONSISTENT with statute** (voluntary service credit provision documented)
- FSMB reports: No specific mandatory topics listed ⚠️ **REQUIRES VERIFICATION** (may indicate minimal requirements or incomplete FSMB data)

**Congruency Assessment:** FSMB data aligns with Virginia statute and administrative code for base requirements. Voluntary service credit is documented in FSMB but conversion rate and mechanics are not detailed. Absence of mandatory topics in FSMB may indicate minimal requirements but requires board verification.

## Conclusion

Virginia MD license renewal requirements are **straightforward and simple** (TIER 1) with a standard biennial CME requirement, minimal documented mandatory topics, and a unique voluntary service credit provision.

**Core Requirements Summary:**
- 60 hours biennial CME: 30 hours minimum AMA Category 1 or AOA equivalent, remaining 30 hours may be Category 1 or Category 2
- Up to 15 Category 2 hours may be earned from voluntary services to low-income patients at local health departments or free clinics
- Mandatory topics not extensively documented (requires board verification)
- Biennial renewal cycle (specific dates not documented)
- Random audits conducted

**Key Simplicity Factors:**
1. Single biennial CME requirement (60 hours)
2. Clear category breakdown (30 Category 1 minimum, 30 flexible)
3. Minimal documented mandatory topics
4. Unique voluntary service credit supports community health and provides flexibility
5. No documented complex multi-cycle or state-specific requirements

**For Physician Compliance:** Complete 60 hours of CME every 2 years (30 hours minimum Category 1, remaining 30 hours may be Category 1 or Category 2). Physicians providing voluntary services to low-income patients at local health departments or free clinics may earn up to 15 Category 2 hours. Contact Virginia Board of Medicine to confirm any mandatory topic requirements and voluntary service credit documentation.

**For Rules Engine Implementation:** The primary implementation challenges are clarifying mandatory topics (if any), voluntary service credit conversion rate and documentation requirements, approved voluntary service sites, and renewal date mechanics. Fee information and procedural details need to be obtained from the board for complete implementation. The voluntary service credit provision requires tracking of volunteer hours and approved service sites.
