## 1. Board Information & Regulatory Authority

### Official Board Information

[FACT - BOARD] The New Hampshire Board of Medicine is the official regulatory agency for physicians in New Hampshire. Website: https://www.nh.gov/ophs/licensing/medicine/. Phone: (603) 271-1203. (Standard research date: 2026-01-02)

[FACT - STATUTE] The New Hampshire Board of Medicine's authority derives from New Hampshire RSA 329:1 et seq., which establishes the board's powers and duties related to licensing and regulation of physicians.

### Primary Statutory Framework

[FACT - STATUTE] New Hampshire RSA 329:12-a is the primary statute governing continuing medical education requirements for physicians. This section establishes the 100-hour CME requirement per biennial cycle.

[FACT - ADMIN_CODE] NH Admin Rules Med 502 provides detailed requirements for continuing medical education, including category requirements and mandatory topics.

[FACT - BOARD] Renewal portal: https://www.oplc.nh.gov/medicine/renewal.htm

### Unified Board Structure

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] New Hampshire operates a unified board for MD and DO physicians under a single board authority, though CME requirements may have subtle differences. This research document covers MD-specific requirements only.

---

## 2. Renewal Cycle & Dates

### Biennial Renewal Schedule

[FACT - STATUTE] New Hampshire physicians renew their medical licenses every 24 months (biennial renewal cycle). RSA 329:17.

[FACT - STATUTE] License renewal is based on the physician's **birth month**, creating individual renewal dates throughout the year rather than a fixed statewide date.

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] Birth month-based renewal distributes renewal processing throughout the year and allows physicians to align CME planning with their birthday cycle.

### Renewal Timeline & Submission Windows

[FACT - BOARD] Physicians may renew online through the Office of Professional Licensure and Certification (OPLC) portal approximately **60-90 days prior** to the expiration date.

[CRITICAL GAP] Specific grace period and late fee information is not documented in readily accessible board materials. This should be clarified with the board.

---

## 3. CME Requirements - Base Hours & Categories

### Total CME Hours Required

[FACT - STATUTE] New Hampshire requires **100 continuing medical education hours every 2 years (biennial cycle)**. RSA 329:12-a.

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] At 100 hours biennial, New Hampshire has one of the higher CME requirements among states, significantly above the common 40-50 hour biennial requirements in many other states.

### Category Requirements - Mixed Category 1 and Category 2

[FACT - STATUTE] Of the 100 required hours:
- **Minimum 40 hours must be AMA PRA Category 1 Credit** (formal CME)
- **Maximum 60 hours may be AMA PRA Category 2 Credit** (informal CME, self-study)

(NH Admin Rules Med 502)

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] New Hampshire's structure allows significant flexibility - physicians can complete all 100 hours as Category 1 if desired, or use up to 60 hours of Category 2 credit to supplement the 40-hour Category 1 minimum.

### CME Categories & Formats

[FACT - STATUTE] Acceptable CME includes:
- **AMA PRA Category 1 Credit:** Formal CME from ACCME-accredited providers, state-recognized specialty societies, live conferences, enduring materials with post-testing
- **AMA PRA Category 2 Credit:** Self-directed learning, journal reading, teaching activities, quality improvement activities, informal educational activities

(NH Admin Rules Med 502)

[CRITICAL GAP] The statute does not specify whether AOA Category 1-A/1-B credit is acceptable for MDs, or if it's restricted to DO physicians. This should be clarified with the board.

### Carryover of Excess CME Hours

[CRITICAL GAP] Research did not identify explicit carryover provisions in accessible statute or board materials. Whether excess CME hours can be carried forward to the next renewal period is unclear and should be verified with the board.

---

## 4. CME Topic Requirements - Mandatory Topics

### Overview of Mandatory Topics

[FACT - STATUTE] New Hampshire has one primary mandatory CME topic that all physicians must address as part of their 100-hour requirement. This is **counted within the 100 hours**, not in addition.

### Topic 1: Pain Management (3 hours, mandatory)

[FACT - STATUTE] All physicians must complete **3 hours of continuing education on pain management** during each biennial renewal period. RSA 329:12-a.

[FACT - STATUTE] Pain management CME must address:
- Safe and effective pain management practices
- Appropriate opioid prescribing
- Recognition of addiction and substance use disorders
- Alternative pain management modalities

(NH Admin Rules Med 502)

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] This requirement applies to all physicians regardless of DEA registration status or prescribing practices, making it broader than many states that limit pain management CME to DEA registrants only.

[CRITICAL GAP] The statute does not clarify whether the 3 hours pain management must be Category 1 or can be Category 2. Best practice would assume Category 1 until confirmed otherwise.

### Other Mandatory Topics - None Identified

[FACT - RESEARCH] Research identified no other state-wide mandatory CME topics beyond pain management. New Hampshire does not appear to have mandatory requirements for:
- Ethics or professionalism
- Human trafficking
- Implicit bias
- Cultural competency
- Controlled substance prescribing (beyond general pain management)

[INFERENCE - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE] The absence of additional mandatory topics makes New Hampshire relatively straightforward compared to states with multiple topic-specific requirements.

---

## 5. Exemptions & Special Circumstances

### Board Certification Exemption (ABMS)

[FACT - STATUTE] Physicians who complete an **ABMS board certification examination** during the biennial renewal period receive credit **equivalent to 100 hours of AMA PRA Category 1 credit**. RSA 329:12-a.

[INFERENCE - HIGH CONFIDENCE] This exemption is significant - passing an ABMS board certification or recertification exam satisfies the ENTIRE biennial CME requirement, including the 3-hour pain management topic requirement.

[CRITICAL QUESTION] Does the exemption apply to:
- Only the year the exam is taken?
- The entire biennial period in which the exam occurs?
- Both the exam year and the following renewal period?

This timing question should be clarified with the board.

[CRITICAL GAP] The statute does not clarify whether:
- Maintenance of Certification (MOC) activities count (or only the actual exam)
- AOA board certification provides equivalent exemption for MD physicians
- Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada (RCPSC) certification is accepted

### First-Time Renewal Provisions

[CRITICAL GAP] Research did not identify explicit first-time renewal exemptions or reduced requirements for newly licensed physicians in accessible statute or board materials. Whether newly licensed physicians have grace periods or reduced CME requirements for their first renewal should be verified with the board.

### Retired or Inactive Physicians

[CRITICAL GAP] Exemptions for retired or inactive physician status are not documented in readily accessible materials. Physicians seeking retired status should contact the board directly.

---

## 6. CME Tracking & Compliance Verification

### CME Documentation Requirements

[FACT - STATUTE] Physicians must maintain documentation of CME completion and provide certificates upon request for audit or verification. NH Admin Rules Med 502.

[CRITICAL GAP] Specific documentation retention requirements (e.g., 2 years, 4 years, 6 years) are not detailed in readily accessible statute or board materials.

### Audit Procedures

[FACT - STATUTE] The New Hampshire Board of Medicine conducts random audits of physicians for CME compliance. NH Admin Rules Med 502.

[CRITICAL GAP] The percentage or frequency of audits is not published in readily accessible statute or board materials.

---

## 7. Renewal Procedures & Fees

### Standard Renewal Process

[FACT - BOARD] Physicians renew through the New Hampshire Office of Professional Licensure and Certification (OPLC) online portal at https://www.oplc.nh.gov/medicine/renewal.htm

[FACT - BOARD] Renewal submission window: **60-90 days before license expiration** (based on birth month).

### Renewal Fees

[CRITICAL GAP] The specific renewal fee amount is not published in readily accessible statute or board materials reviewed. This should be obtained from the board directly or through the renewal portal.

### Grace Period & Late Renewal

[CRITICAL GAP] Grace period mechanics and late fees are not documented in readily accessible statute or board materials. This should be clarified with the board.

## Conclusion

New Hampshire MD license renewal requirements are **straightforward** (TIER 1) with a high total hour requirement (100 hours biennial) but simple structure and minimal mandatory topics.

**Core Requirements Summary:**
- 100 hours biennial CME (40 hrs minimum Category 1, maximum 60 hrs Category 2)
- Mandatory topic: Pain management (3 hours)
- Board certification exemption: ABMS exam = 100 hrs Category 1 equivalent
- Renewal: Biennial based on birth month
- No board certification exemption timing clarified
- No documented carryover policy

**For Physician Compliance:** Complete 100 hours CME biennial (minimum 40 Category 1, maximum 60 Category 2), ensure 3 hours pain management is included. If taking ABMS board exam during renewal period, verify exemption applicability with board. Maintain CME documentation for potential audit.

**For Rules Engine Implementation:** The main implementation challenges are the birth month-based renewal timing (requires individual tracking per physician), the board certification exemption timing ambiguity (when does it apply?), and the lack of documented carryover policy. The high total hours (100 vs 40-50 in many states) and clear category split (40 Cat 1 minimum, 60 Cat 2 maximum) are straightforward to implement once procedural gaps are resolved.
