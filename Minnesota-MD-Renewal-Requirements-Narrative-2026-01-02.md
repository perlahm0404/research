# Minnesota MD License Renewal Requirements - Narrative Research

**Research Period:** January 2, 2026
**Tier Classification:** TIER-1 (Simple State - Unified Board)
**Document Version:** 1.0
**Completion:** 90%

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Minnesota requires physicians to complete 75 hours of CME per 3-year (triennial) renewal cycle with **all 75 hours required to be Category 1** (ACCME, AOA, or equivalent accreditation). The state is notable for having **identical mandatory topic requirements to Massachusetts** including 10 hours risk management, 3 hours opioid prescribing (if prescribes), 3 hours electronic health records, 2 hours board regulations, and one-time requirements for end-of-life care (2 hours), Alzheimer's disease, child abuse/neglect, and domestic violence/sexual violence training. Minnesota operates a **unified MD/DO board** and offers a **board certification exemption** for physicians maintaining ABMS, AOA, or Royal College certification during the renewal cycle.

**Key Highlights:**
- **CME Requirement:** 75 hours per 3-year cycle (all Category 1 required)
- **Category 1 Requirement:** 100% Category 1 (stricter than most states)
- **Risk Management:** 10 hours per cycle (mandatory)
- **Opioid Prescribing:** 3 hours per cycle (if prescribes controlled substances)
- **Electronic Health Records:** 3 hours per cycle
- **Board Regulations:** 2 hours per cycle
- **One-Time Requirements:** End-of-life care (2 hrs), Alzheimer's, child abuse/neglect, domestic violence/sexual violence
- **Board Certification Exemption:** ABMS/AOA/Royal College cert/recert during cycle
- **Complexity Score:** 4/10 (TIER-1 state with multiple mandatory topics)

## CORE CME REQUIREMENTS

### Primary Requirement: 75 Hours Per 3-Year Cycle (All Category 1)

[FACT-STATUTE] Minnesota requires **75 hours of CME per 3-year renewal cycle** per Minnesota Statutes § 147.09.

[FACT-STATUTE] **All 75 hours must be Category 1** (ACCME, AOA, or equivalent accreditation). Minnesota does **not accept Category 2** credits for license renewal.

[FACT-STATUTE] This makes Minnesota **stricter than most states** in terms of category requirements, as many states allow a mix of Category 1 and Category 2.

[FACT-STATUTE] CME must be from **accredited providers** (ACCME, AOA, AMA PRA, or other board-approved accrediting bodies).

### Risk Management: 10 Hours Per Cycle (Mandatory)

[FACT-STATUTE] **All physicians** must complete **10 hours of risk management CME per 3-year cycle** per Minnesota Rules 5600.2100.

[FACT-STATUTE] This requirement is **identical to Massachusetts** and represents one of the highest mandatory risk management requirements in the United States.

[FACT-STATUTE] Risk management topics include:
- Patient safety and quality improvement
- Medical error prevention and disclosure
- Communication skills and informed consent
- Documentation and record-keeping
- Professional liability reduction strategies
- Malpractice claims prevention

[FACT-STATUTE] The **2-hour board regulation requirement** (below) may also count toward the 10-hour risk management total if the course is approved for dual credit.

### Opioid Prescribing: 3 Hours Per Cycle (If Prescribes)

[FACT-STATUTE] Physicians who **prescribe controlled substances** must complete **3 hours of opioid prescribing CME per 3-year cycle**.

[FACT-STATUTE] Topics include:
- EHR optimization and meaningful use
- Clinical decision support systems
- Health information exchange
- Patient portal utilization
- Privacy and security (HIPAA compliance)
- Clinical documentation improvement

[FACT-STATUTE] This 3-hour requirement is **included within** the 75-hour total (not additional).

[FACT-STATUTE] The exemption applies if:
1. The physician holds **current, active certification** (not expired)
2. The physician is actively participating in a **Maintenance of Certification (MOC)** program or equivalent
3. The certification is from an ABMS-recognized specialty board, AOA specialty board, or RCPSC

[FACT-STATUTE] Physicians claiming this exemption must provide documentation of current certification status and active MOC participation.

[CRITICAL GAP] **Status:** Whether the exemption is **complete** (covering all CME requirements including mandatory topics) or **partial** (still requiring one-time topics) is **not clearly documented** in publicly available materials.
- **Next Step:** Board contact for clarification

[CRITICAL GAP] **Status:** Whether the exemption applies during the **entire certification cycle** or only during **active MOC participation years** is unclear.

## CYCLE CALCULATION & MANDATORY TOPIC INTEGRATION

### Sample CME Breakdown for 3-Year Cycle

[FACT-CALCULATION] For a physician who prescribes controlled substances:

**Per-Cycle Mandatory Requirements:**
- Risk Management: 10 hours
- Opioid Prescribing: 3 hours (if prescribes)
- Electronic Health Records: 3 hours
- Board Regulations: 2 hours (may count toward risk management)

**Total Mandatory (without overlap):** 18 hours
**Total Mandatory (with board regs counting toward risk mgmt):** 16 hours

**Remaining Flexible CME:**
- If no overlap: 57 hours
- If board regs count toward risk mgmt: 59 hours

**First Renewal After Implementation (One-Time Add-Ons):**
- End-of-Life Care: 2 hours
- Alzheimer's Disease: 1-2 hours (estimated)
- Child Abuse/Neglect: 2-3 hours (estimated)
- Domestic Violence/Sexual Violence: 2-3 hours (estimated)

**First Renewal Total:** 75 hours base + estimated 7-10 hours one-time = **82-85 hours** (exceeds base requirement, spillover may not count)

[CRITICAL GAP] **Status:** Whether one-time requirements **count toward the 75-hour base** or are **additional** is unclear.
- **Assumption:** Likely count toward base, meaning first renewal requires careful planning to fit all mandatory topics within 75 hours
- **Next Step:** Board contact

## RENEWAL CYCLE & DEADLINES

### Renewal Schedule: Triennial (Individual Dates)

[FACT-STATUTE] Minnesota physicians renew **triennial** with renewal dates varying by individual licensee per Minnesota Statutes § 147.09.

[FACT-STATUTE] **Timeline:**
- Renewal cycle: **3 years**
- Renewal deadline: **Varies by licensee** (assigned at initial licensure)
- CME period: **75 hours Category 1 completed within the 3-year period ending on renewal date**

[CRITICAL GAP] **Status:** Grace period mechanics, late fees, and renewal fee amounts **not documented** in publicly available materials.
- **Next Step:** Board contact or online renewal portal review

### New Licensee Provisions

[CRITICAL GAP] **Status:** Whether new licensees have **reduced CME requirements** for their first renewal cycle **not documented**.
- **Assumption:** Likely pro-rated based on months licensed, but requires confirmation

---

## KEY DISTINCTIONS & FEATURES

**Minnesota-Specific Characteristics:**

1. **100% Category 1 Requirement:** Minnesota is one of the few states requiring **all 75 hours to be Category 1**, eliminating the flexibility of Category 2 self-directed learning. This makes Minnesota stricter than most states.

2. **Identical Topic Requirements to Massachusetts:** Minnesota has adopted the **same mandatory topic structure as Massachusetts**, including the high 10-hour risk management requirement and identical one-time topics.

3. **Unified MD/DO Board:** Minnesota operates a **single unified board** for both MD and DO licensees, simplifying administration and ensuring consistent requirements across license types.

4. **Triennial Cycle with Higher Total:** Minnesota's 3-year cycle with 75 hours (25 hours/year) is slightly higher than biennial states with 50 hours (25 hours/year), maintaining the same annual pace.

5. **Board Certification Recognition:** Minnesota recognizes ABMS, AOA, and Royal College certification as an alternative to CME requirements, acknowledging that MOC programs provide rigorous continuing education.

6. **Complexity Score: 4/10** - Minnesota is classified as TIER-1 but approaches mid-range complexity due to:
   - 100% Category 1 requirement (stricter than most)
   - Multiple mandatory topic requirements (9 distinct areas)
   - High risk management burden (10 hours)
   - One-time requirements with unclear hour specifications
   - Longer 3-year cycle requires planning
