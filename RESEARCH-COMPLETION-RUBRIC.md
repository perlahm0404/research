# Research Completion Rubric - Data Quality Standards
**Version:** 1.0
**Created:** 2026-01-02
**Purpose:** Define quality metrics for state CME research across all three tiers

---

## OVERVIEW

This rubric defines what "complete" means for each tier, with specific scoring criteria for each section of the research deliverable.

**Three Completion Levels:**
1. **MINIMUM (50%)** - Publishable, answers core questions, has known gaps
2. **STANDARD (70%)** - Professional quality, comprehensive, limited gaps
3. **COMPREHENSIVE (85%+)** - Validation-ready, near-complete, all gaps documented

---

**Tier 2 Completion Score Calculation:**
- Two documents, each scored independently
- Each document: 17 sections (from Tier 1 rubric) = possible 51 points
- MD Score = (Total MD Points / 51) × 100
- DO Score = (Total DO Points / 51) × 100
- Overall Tier 2 Score = Average(MD Score, DO Score)
- Target: 70% in both MD and DO documents

**Bonus Criteria for Tier 2:**
- [ ] +5% if comparison table is comprehensive and well-sourced
- [ ] +5% if statutory differences are explained with regulatory context
- [ ] +5% if different CME tracking systems documented

- 1-2 attempted sources per gap noted
- Impact on rules engine noted for CRITICAL gaps

**Comprehensive (85%+):**
- 5+ gaps listed with CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW priority
- Detailed description for each
- "What We Know" section (facts that relate to gap)
- "What We Don't Know" section (specific unknowns)
- 3+ attempted sources per gap with search terms
- Verification method proposed (board contact, FOIA, legislative search, etc.)
- Rules engine impact explained
- Contact information for board provided
- Estimated effort to resolve each gap

**Example of Comprehensive Gap:**
```
## CRITICAL GAPS

- [ ] **GAP ID:** OK-DO-CME-HOURS-001
  **Description:** Total CME hour requirement for DO physicians unknown

  **Priority:** CRITICAL

  **What We Know:**
  - [FACT - BOARD] 1 hour prescribing education required annually
  - [FACT - STATUTE] 62 O.S. § 620-642 governs DO licensing
  - [FACT - BOARD] CE Broker used for CME tracking

  **What We Don't Know:**
  - Total CME hours per renewal cycle
  - Renewal frequency (annual? triennial?)
  - Category requirements (AOA Category 1-A?)
  - Topic-specific mandates beyond prescribing

  **Attempted Sources:**
  1. 62 O.S. § 620-642 (Full statute) - Searched "continuing education", "CME" -
     Result: Found only prescribing requirement, no total hours mandate
  2. Oklahoma Administrative Code Title 510 (Osteopathic Board) - Searched via
     Corporation Commission database - Result: Found Title 510-10-3-8 but limited detail
  3. OSBOE Website (https://www.ok.gov/osboe/) - Searched "CME requirements", "renewal" -
     Result: Contact form only, no CME details published
  4. FSMB Document (continuing-medical-education-by-state.pdf) - Page references to Oklahoma DO -
     Result: Shows "16 hours every year" per Admin Code 510:10-3-8

  **Verification Methods (in priority order):**
  1. Contact OSBOE directly: (405) 528-8625 or licensing@osboe.ok.gov
  2. FOIA request to OSBOE for board meeting minutes (often contain regulatory discussion)
  3. Search Oklahoma legislature for any DO-specific CME bills (2020-2026)
  4. Verify FSMB citation in administrative code (confirm 16 hrs/yr is current)

  **Rules Engine Impact:**
  CRITICAL - Cannot calculate renewal compliance for DO physicians without knowing:
  - Total requirement (16/yr per FSMB, but statute unclear)
  - Renewal frequency (if annual, 16/yr works; if triennial, would be 48/3yr)
  - Topic exceptions/exemptions beyond prescribing

  **Contact Methods:**
  - Board Email: licensing@osboe.ok.gov
  - Board Phone: (405) 528-8625
  - Physical Address: [if available]

  **Estimated Resolution Effort:** 30 minutes (phone call to board)
```

## CROSS-SOURCE CONGRUENCY TRACKING

**Minimum:** 1-2 requirements with congruency noted

**Standard:**
- 4-5 major requirements have congruency tracked
- Sources listed (STATUTE, ADMIN_CODE, BOARD, FSMB)
- Congruency marked as ✅ (agreement) or ⚠️ (conflict)

**Comprehensive:**
- All major requirements (7+) have congruency tracked
- Detailed source alignment matrix created
- Conflicts explained with resolution methodology
- Source hierarchy applied when conflict detected

**Example:**
```
## Cross-Source Congruency Tracking

| Requirement | Statute | Admin Code | Board Website | FSMB | Congruency |
|-------------|---------|------------|---------------|------|-----------|
| Total CME Hours | 60/3yr | 60/3yr | 60/3yr | 60/3yr | 4/4 ✅ |
| Category | All Cat 1 | All Cat 1 | All Cat 1 | All Cat 1 | 4/4 ✅ |
| Opioid Requirement | 1 hr/yr | 1 hr/yr | 1 hr/yr | Not mentioned | 3/4 ✅ (FSMB gap) |
| PDMP Training | Not found | Unclear | Recommended | Not mentioned | Conflict ⚠️ |

**Conflict Resolution:** PDMP training appears in board FAQs but not statute/admin code.
Per source hierarchy (Statute > Admin Code > Board Website), PDMP is not mandatory
requirement but board-recommended practice.
```
